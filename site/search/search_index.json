However, many renderers -- like Github's and Markdown Here -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the highlight.js demo page . Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it. Inline code has back-ticks around it. Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ``` , or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting. ```javascript var s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\"; alert(s); ``` ```python s = \"Python syntax highlighting\" print s ``` ``` No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>. ``` var s \\= \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\"; alert(s); s \\= \"Python syntax highlighting\" print s No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github). But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>. Footnotes Footnotes aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they supported by GFM . Here is a simple footnote[^1]. A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2]. You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note]. [^1]: My reference. [^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces. This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines. [^note]: Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking. This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines. Renders to: Tables Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

Horizontal Rule Three or more... --- Hyphens *** Asterisks ___ Underscores Three or more... Hyphens Asterisks Underscores Line Breaks My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover -- hit once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You'll soon learn to get what you want. \"Markdown Toggle\" is your friend. Here are some things to try out: Here's a line for us to start with. This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*. This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
