The flags define who can read, write to or execute the file. When you list files with the `-l` (long format) option you\u2019ll see a string of characters that look like -rwxrwxrwx If the first character is a - the item is a file, if it is a d the item is a directory. The rest of the string is three sets of three characters. From the left, the first three represent the file permissions of the owner , the middle three represent the file permissions of the group and the rightmost three characters represent the permissions for others . In each set, an r stands for read, a w stands for write, and an x stands for execute. If the r , w , or x character is present that file permission is granted. If the letter is not present and a - appears instead, that file permission is not granted. One way to use chmod is to provide the permissions you wish to give to the owner, group, and others as a 3 digit number. The leftmost digit represents the owner. The middle digit represents the group. The rightmost digit represents the others.

However, many renderers -- like Github's and Markdown Here -- support syntax highlighting. Which languages are supported and how those language names should be written will vary from renderer to renderer. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the highlight.js demo page . Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it. Inline code has back-ticks around it. Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ``` , or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks -- they're easier and only they support syntax highlighting. ```javascript var s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\"; alert(s); ``` ```python s = \"Python syntax highlighting\" print s ``` ``` No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2]. You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note]. [^1]: My reference. [^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.

This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines. Renders to: Tables \u00b6 Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email -- a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application.

You'll soon learn to get what you want. \"Markdown Toggle\" is your friend. Here are some things to try out: Here's a line for us to start with. This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*. This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
