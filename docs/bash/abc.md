This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or programming, yet progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced level of instruction _. . . all the while sneaking in little nuggets of UNIXÂ® wisdom and lore_. It serves as a textbook, a manual for self-study, and as a reference and source of knowledge on shell scripting techniques. The exercises and heavily-commented examples invite active reader participation, under the premise that **the only way to really learn scripting is to write scripts**.

This book is suitable for classroom use as a general introduction to programming concepts.

The shell is a command interpreter. More than just the insulating layer between the operating system kernel and the user, it's also a fairly powerful programming language. A shell program, called a _script_, is an easy-to-use tool for building applications by "gluing together" system calls, tools, utilities, and compiled binaries. Virtually the entire repertoire of UNIX commands, utilities, and tools is available for invocation by a shell script. If that were not enough, internal shell commands, such as testing and loop constructs, lend additional power and flexibility to scripts. Shell scripts are especially well suited for administrative system tasks and other routine repetitive tasks not requiring the bells and whistles of a full-blown tightly structured programming language.

Chapter 1. Shell Programming!
=============================

Â 

_

_No programming language is perfect. There is not even a single best language; there are only languages well suited or perhaps poorly suited for particular purposes._

_\--Herbert Mayer_

_

A working knowledge of shell scripting is essential to anyone wishing to become reasonably proficient at system administration, even if they do not anticipate ever having to actually write a script. Consider that as a Linux machine boots up, it executes the shell scripts in /etc/rc.d to restore the system configuration and set up services. A detailed understanding of these startup scripts is important for analyzing the behavior of a system, and possibly modifying it.

The craft of scripting is not hard to master, since scripts can be built in bite-sized sections and there is only a fairly small set of shell-specific operators and options [\[1\]](#FTN.AEN62) to learn. The syntax is simple -- even austere -- similar to that of invoking and chaining together utilities at the command line, and there are only a few "rules" governing their use. Most short scripts work right the first time, and debugging even the longer ones is straightforward.

A shell script is a quick-and-dirty method of prototyping a complex application. Getting even a limited subset of the functionality to work in a script is often a useful first stage in project development. In this way, the structure of the application can be tested and tinkered with, and the major pitfalls found before proceeding to the final coding in _C_, _C++_, _Java_, [Perl](#PERLREF), or _Python_.

Shell scripting hearkens back to the classic UNIX philosophy of breaking complex projects into simpler subtasks, of chaining together components and utilities. Many consider this a better, or at least more esthetically pleasing approach to problem solving than using one of the new generation of high-powered all-in-one languages, such as _Perl_, which attempt to be all things to all people, but at the cost of forcing you to alter your thinking processes to fit the tool.

According to [Herbert Mayer](#MAYERREF), "a useful language needs arrays, pointers, and a generic mechanism for building data structures." By these criteria, shell scripting falls somewhat short of being "useful." Or, perhaps not. . . .

When not to use shell scripts

*   Resource-intensive tasks, especially where speed is a factor (sorting, hashing, recursion [\[2\]](#FTN.AEN87) ...)
    
*   Procedures involving heavy-duty math operations, especially floating point arithmetic, arbitrary precision calculations, or complex numbers (use _C++_ or _FORTRAN_ instead)
    
*   Cross-platform portability required (use _C_ or _Java_ instead)
    
*   Complex applications, where structured programming is a necessity (type-checking of variables, function prototypes, etc.)
    
*   Mission-critical applications upon which you are betting the future of the company
    
*   Situations where _security_ is important, where you need to guarantee the integrity of your system and protect against intrusion, cracking, and vandalism
    
*   Project consists of subcomponents with interlocking dependencies
    
*   Extensive file operations required (_Bash_ is limited to serial file access, and that only in a particularly clumsy and inefficient line-by-line fashion.)
    
*   Need native support for multi-dimensional arrays
    
*   Need data structures, such as linked lists or trees
    
*   Need to generate / manipulate graphics or GUIs
    
*   Need direct access to system hardware or external peripherals
    
*   Need port or [socket](#SOCKETREF) I/O
    
*   Need to use libraries or interface with legacy code
    
*   Proprietary, closed-source applications (Shell scripts put the source code right out in the open for all the world to see.)
    

If any of the above applies, consider a more powerful scripting language -- perhaps _Perl_, _Tcl_, _Python_, _Ruby_ -- or possibly a compiled language such as _C_, _C++_, or _Java_. Even then, prototyping the application as a shell script might still be a useful development step.

We will be using Bash, an acronym [\[3\]](#FTN.AEN139) for "Bourne-Again shell" and a pun on Stephen Bourne's now classic _Bourne_ shell. Bash has become a _de facto_ standard for shell scripting on most flavors of UNIX. Most of the principles this book covers apply equally well to scripting with other shells, such as the _Korn Shell_, from which Bash derives some of its features, [\[4\]](#FTN.AEN147) and the _C Shell_ and its variants. (Note that _C Shell_ programming is not recommended due to certain inherent problems, as pointed out in an October, 1993 [Usenet post](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/csh-whynot/) by Tom Christiansen.)

What follows is a tutorial on shell scripting. It relies heavily on examples to illustrate various features of the shell. The example scripts work -- they've been tested, insofar as possible -- and some of them are even useful in real life. The reader can play with the actual working code of the examples in the source archive (scriptname.sh or scriptname.bash), [\[5\]](#FTN.AEN157) give them _execute_ permission (**chmod u+rx scriptname**), then run them to see what happens. Should the [source archive](http://bash.deta.in/abs-guide-latest.tar.bz2) not be available, then cut-and-paste from the [HTML](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/abs-guide.html.tar.gz) or [pdf](http://bash.deta.in/abs-guide.pdf) rendered versions. Be aware that some of the scripts presented here introduce features before they are explained, and this may require the reader to temporarily skip ahead for enlightenment.

Unless otherwise noted, [the author](mailto:thegrendel.abs@gmail.com) of this book wrote the example scripts that follow.

Chapter 2. Starting Off With a Sha-Bang
=======================================

_Shell programming is a 1950s juke box . . ._

_\--Larry Wall_

_

In the simplest case, a script is nothing more than a list of system commands stored in a file. At the very least, this saves the effort of retyping that particular sequence of commands each time it is invoked.

**Example 2-1. _cleanup_: A script to clean up log files in /var/log**

\# Cleanup
# Run as root, of course.

cd /var/log
cat /dev/null > messages
cat /dev/null > wtmp
echo "Log files cleaned up."

There is nothing unusual here, only a set of commands that could just as easily have been invoked one by one from the command-line on the console or in a terminal window. The advantages of placing the commands in a script go far beyond not having to retype them time and again. The script becomes a _program_ -- a _tool_ -- and it can easily be modified or customized for a particular application.

**Example 2-2. _cleanup_: An improved clean-up script**

#!/bin/bash
# Proper header for a Bash script.

# Cleanup, version 2

# Run as root, of course.
# Insert code here to print error message and exit if not root.

LOG\_DIR=/var/log
# Variables are better than hard-coded values.
cd $LOG\_DIR

cat /dev/null > messages
cat /dev/null > wtmp


echo "Logs cleaned up."

exit #  The right and proper method of "exiting" from a script.
     #  A bare "exit" (no parameter) returns the exit status
     #+ of the preceding command. 

Now _that's_ beginning to look like a real script. But we can go even farther . . .

**Example 2-3. _cleanup_: An enhanced and generalized version of above scripts.**

#!/bin/bash
# Cleanup, version 3

#  Warning:
#  -------
#  This script uses quite a number of features that will be explained
#+ later on.
#  By the time you've finished the first half of the book,
#+ there should be nothing mysterious about it.



LOG\_DIR=/var/log
ROOT\_UID=0     # Only users with $UID 0 have root privileges.
LINES=50       # Default number of lines saved.
E\_XCD=86       # Can't change directory?
E\_NOTROOT=87   # Non-root exit error.


# Run as root, of course.
if \[ "$UID" -ne "$ROOT\_UID" \]
then
  echo "Must be root to run this script."
  exit $E\_NOTROOT
fi  

if \[ -n "$1" \]
# Test whether command-line argument is present (non-empty).
then
  lines=$1
else  
  lines=$LINES # Default, if not specified on command-line.
fi  


#  Stephane Chazelas suggests the following,
#+ as a better way of checking command-line arguments,
#+ but this is still a bit advanced for this stage of the tutorial.
#
#    E\_WRONGARGS=85  # Non-numerical argument (bad argument format).
#
#    case "$1" in
#    ""      ) lines=50;;
#    \*\[!0-9\]\*) echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` lines-to-cleanup";
#     exit $E\_WRONGARGS;;
#    \*       ) lines=$1;;
#    esac
#
#\* Skip ahead to "Loops" chapter to decipher all this.


cd $LOG\_DIR

if \[ \`pwd\` != "$LOG\_DIR" \]  # or   if \[ "$PWD" != "$LOG\_DIR" \]
                            # Not in /var/log?
then
  echo "Can't change to $LOG\_DIR."
  exit $E\_XCD
fi  # Doublecheck if in right directory before messing with log file.

# Far more efficient is:
#
# cd /var/log || {
#   echo "Cannot change to necessary directory." >&2
#   exit $E\_XCD;
# }




tail -n $lines messages > mesg.temp # Save last section of message log file.
mv mesg.temp messages               # Rename it as system log file.


#  cat /dev/null > messages
#\* No longer needed, as the above method is safer.

cat /dev/null > wtmp  #  ': > wtmp' and '> wtmp'  have the same effect.
echo "Log files cleaned up."
#  Note that there are other log files in /var/log not affected
#+ by this script.

exit 0
#  A zero return value from the script upon exit indicates success
#+ to the shell.

Since you may not wish to wipe out the entire system log, this version of the script keeps the last section of the message log intact. You will constantly discover ways of fine-tuning previously written scripts for increased effectiveness.

\* \* \*

The _sha-bang_ ( #!) [\[6\]](#FTN.AEN205) at the head of a script tells your system that this file is a set of commands to be fed to the command interpreter indicated. The #! is actually a two-byte [\[7\]](#FTN.AEN214) _magic number_, a special marker that designates a file type, or in this case an executable shell script (type **man magic** for more details on this fascinating topic). Immediately following the _sha-bang_ is a _path name_. This is the path to the program that interprets the commands in the script, whether it be a shell, a programming language, or a utility. This command interpreter then executes the commands in the script, starting at the top (the line following the _sha-bang_ line), and ignoring comments. [\[8\]](#FTN.AEN226)

#!/bin/sh
#!/bin/bash
#!/usr/bin/perl
#!/usr/bin/tcl
#!/bin/sed -f
#!/bin/awk -f

Each of the above script header lines calls a different command interpreter, be it /bin/sh, the default shell (**bash** in a Linux system) or otherwise. [\[9\]](#FTN.AEN242) Using **#!/bin/sh**, the default Bourne shell in most commercial variants of UNIX, makes the script [portable](#PORTABILITYISSUES) to non-Linux machines, though you [sacrifice Bash-specific features](#BINSH). The script will, however, conform to the POSIX [\[10\]](#FTN.AEN256) **sh** standard.

Note that the path given at the "sha-bang" must be correct, otherwise an error message -- usually "Command not found." -- will be the only result of running the script. [\[11\]](#FTN.AEN269)

#! can be omitted if the script consists only of a set of generic system commands, using no internal shell directives. The second example, above, requires the initial #!, since the variable assignment line, **lines=50**, uses a shell-specific construct. [\[12\]](#FTN.AEN279) Note again that **#!/bin/sh** invokes the default shell interpreter, which defaults to /bin/bash on a Linux machine.

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

This tutorial encourages a modular approach to constructing a script. Make note of and collect "boilerplate" code snippets that might be useful in future scripts. Eventually you will build quite an extensive library of nifty routines. As an example, the following script prolog tests whether the script has been invoked with the correct number of parameters.

E\_WRONG\_ARGS=85
script\_parameters="-a -h -m -z"
#                  -a = all, -h = help, etc.

if \[ $# -ne $Number\_of\_expected\_args \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` $script\_parameters"
  # \`basename $0\` is the script's filename.
  exit $E\_WRONG\_ARGS
fi

Many times, you will write a script that carries out one particular task. The first script in this chapter is an example. Later, it might occur to you to generalize the script to do other, similar tasks. Replacing the literal ("hard-wired") constants by variables is a step in that direction, as is replacing repetitive code blocks by [functions](#FUNCTIONREF).

* * *

2.1. Invoking the script
========================

Having written the script, you can invoke it by **sh scriptname**, [\[13\]](#FTN.AEN300) or alternatively **bash scriptname**. (Not recommended is using **sh <scriptname**, since this effectively disables reading from [stdin](#STDINOUTDEF) within the script.) Much more convenient is to make the script itself directly executable with a [chmod](#CHMODREF).

Either:

**chmod 555 scriptname** (gives everyone read/execute permission) [\[14\]](#FTN.AEN315)

or

**chmod +rx scriptname** (gives everyone read/execute permission)

**chmod u+rx scriptname** (gives only the script owner read/execute permission)

Having made the script executable, you may now test it by **./scriptname**. [\[15\]](#FTN.AEN327) If it begins with a "sha-bang" line, invoking the script calls the correct command interpreter to run it.

As a final step, after testing and debugging, you would likely want to move it to /usr/local/bin (as _root_, of course), to make the script available to yourself and all other users as a systemwide executable. The script could then be invoked by simply typing **scriptname** **\[ENTER\]** from the command-line.

* * *

2.2. Preliminary Exercises
==========================

1.  System administrators often write scripts to automate common tasks. Give several instances where such scripts would be useful.
    
2.  Write a script that upon invocation shows the [time and date](#DATEREF), [lists all logged-in users](#WHOREF), and gives the system [uptime](#UPTIMEREF). The script then [saves this information](#IOREDIRREF) to a logfile.

Chapter 3. Special Characters
=============================

What makes a character _special_? If it has a meaning beyond its _literal meaning_, a [meta-meaning](#METAMEANINGREF), then we refer to it as a _special character_. Along with commands and [keywords](#KEYWORDREF), _special characters_ are building blocks of Bash scripts.

**Special Characters Found In Scripts and Elsewhere**

#

**Comments.** Lines beginning with a # (with the exception of [#!](#MAGNUMREF)) are comments and will _not_ be executed.

\# This line is a comment.

Comments may also occur following the end of a command.

echo "A comment will follow." # Comment here.
#                            ^ Note whitespace before #

Comments may also follow [whitespace](#WHITESPACEREF) at the beginning of a line.

     # A tab precedes this comment.

Comments may even be embedded within a [pipe](#PIPEREF).

initial=( \`cat "$startfile" | sed -e '/#/d' | tr -d '\\n' |\\
# Delete lines containing '#' comment character.
           sed -e 's/\\./\\. /g' -e 's/\_/\_ /g'\` )
# Excerpted from life.sh script

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

A command may not follow a comment on the same line. There is no method of terminating the comment, in order for "live code" to begin on the same line. Use a new line for the next command.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Of course, a [quoted](#QUOTINGREF) or an [escaped](#ESCP) # in an [echo](#ECHOREF) statement does _not_ begin a comment. Likewise, a # appears in [certain parameter-substitution constructs](#PSUB2) and in [numerical constant expressions](#NUMCONSTANTS).

echo "The # here does not begin a comment."
echo 'The # here does not begin a comment.'
echo The \\# here does not begin a comment.
echo The # here begins a comment.

echo ${PATH#\*:}       # Parameter substitution, not a comment.
echo $(( 2#101011 ))  # Base conversion, not a comment.

# Thanks, S.C.

The standard [quoting and escape](#QUOTINGREF) characters (" ' \\) escape the #.

Certain [pattern matching operations](#PSOREX1) also use the #.

;

**Command separator \[semicolon\].** Permits putting two or more commands on the same line.

echo hello; echo there


if \[ -x "$filename" \]; then    #  Note the space after the semicolon.
#+                   ^^
  echo "File $filename exists."; cp $filename $filename.bak
else   #                       ^^
  echo "File $filename not found."; touch $filename
fi; echo "File test complete."

Note that the ";" [sometimes needs to be _escaped_](#FINDREF0).

;;

**Terminator in a [case](#CASEESAC1) option \[double semicolon\].**

case "$variable" in
  abc)  echo "\\$variable = abc" ;;
  xyz)  echo "\\$variable = xyz" ;;
esac

;;&, ;&

**[Terminators](#NCTERM) in a _case_ option ([version 4+](#BASH4REF) of Bash).**

.

**"dot" command \[period\].** Equivalent to [source](#SOURCEREF) (see [Example 15-22](#EX38)). This is a bash [builtin](#BUILTINREF).

.

**"dot", as a component of a filename.** When working with filenames, a leading dot is the prefix of a "hidden" file, a file that an [ls](#LSREF) will not normally show.

When considering directory names, _a single dot_ represents the current working directory, and _two dots_ denote the parent directory.

bash$ **pwd**
/home/bozo/projects

bash$ **cd .**
bash$ **pwd**
/home/bozo/projects

bash$ **cd ..**
bash$ **pwd**
/home/bozo/
	        

The _dot_ often appears as the destination (directory) of a file movement command, in this context meaning _current directory_.

bash$ **cp /home/bozo/current\_work/junk/\* .**
	        

Copy all the "junk" files to [$PWD](#PWDREF).

.

**"dot" character match.** When [matching characters](#REGEXDOT), as part of a [regular expression](#REGEXREF), a "dot" [matches a single character](#REGEXDOT).

"

**[partial quoting](#DBLQUO) \[double quote\].** _"STRING"_ preserves (from interpretation) most of the special characters within _STRING_. See [Chapter 5](#QUOTING).

'

**[full quoting](#SNGLQUO) \[single quote\].** _'STRING'_ preserves all special characters within _STRING_. This is a stronger form of quoting than _"STRING"_. See [Chapter 5](#QUOTING).

,

**[comma operator](#COMMAOP).** The _comma operator_ [\[16\]](#FTN.AEN612) links together a series of arithmetic operations. All are evaluated, but only the last one is returned.

let "t2 = ((a = 9, 15 / 3))"
# Set "a = 9" and "t2 = 15 / 3"

The _comma_ operator can also concatenate strings.

for file in /{,usr/}bin/\*calc
#             ^    Find all executable files ending in "calc"
#+                 in /bin and /usr/bin directories.
do
        if \[ -x "$file" \]
        then
          echo $file
        fi
done

# /bin/ipcalc
# /usr/bin/kcalc

# /usr/bin/oocalc


# Thank you, Rory Winston, for pointing this out.

,, ,

**[Lowercase conversion](#CASEMODPARAMSUB) in _parameter substitution_ (added in [version 4](#BASH4REF) of Bash).**

\\

**[escape](#ESCP) \[backslash\].** A quoting mechanism for single characters.

**\\X** _escapes_ the character _X_. This has the effect of "quoting" _X_, equivalent to _'X'_. The \\ may be used to quote " and ', so they are expressed literally.

See [Chapter 5](#QUOTING) for an in-depth explanation of escaped characters.

/

**Filename path separator \[forward slash\].** Separates the components of a filename (as in /home/bozo/projects/Makefile).

This is also the division [arithmetic operator](#AROPS1).

\`

**[command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF).** The **\`command\`** construct makes available the output of **command** for assignment to a variable. This is also known as [backquotes](#BACKQUOTESREF) or backticks.

:

**null command \[colon\].** This is the shell equivalent of a "NOP" (_no op_, a do-nothing operation). It may be considered a synonym for the shell builtin [true](#TRUEREF). The ":" command is itself a _Bash_ [builtin](#BUILTINREF), and its [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) is _true_ (0).

:
echo $?   # 0

Endless loop:

while :
do
   operation-1
   operation-2
   ...
   operation-n
done

# Same as:
#    while true
#    do
#      ...
#    done

Placeholder in if/then test:

if condition
then :   # Do nothing and branch ahead
else     # Or else ...
   take-some-action
fi

Provide a placeholder where a binary operation is expected, see [Example 8-2](#ARITHOPS) and [default parameters](#DEFPARAM).

: ${username=\`whoami\`}
# ${username=\`whoami\`}   Gives an error without the leading :
#                        unless "username" is a command or builtin...

: ${1?"Usage: $0 ARGUMENT"}     # From "usage-message.sh example script.

Provide a placeholder where a command is expected in a [here document](#HEREDOCREF). See [Example 19-10](#ANONHEREDOC).

Evaluate string of variables using [parameter substitution](#PARAMSUBREF) (as in [Example 10-7](#EX6)).

: ${HOSTNAME?} ${USER?} ${MAIL?}
#  Prints error message
#+ if one or more of essential environmental variables not set.

**[Variable expansion / substring replacement](#EXPREPL1)**.

In combination with the \> [redirection operator](#IOREDIRREF), truncates a file to zero length, without changing its permissions. If the file did not previously exist, creates it.

: > data.xxx   # File "data.xxx" now empty.	      

# Same effect as   cat /dev/null >data.xxx
# However, this does not fork a new process, since ":" is a builtin.

See also [Example 16-15](#EX12).

In combination with the \>> redirection operator, has no effect on a pre-existing target file (**: >> target\_file**). If the file did not previously exist, creates it.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

This applies to regular files, not pipes, symlinks, and certain special files.

May be used to begin a comment line, although this is not recommended. Using # for a comment turns off error checking for the remainder of that line, so almost anything may appear in a comment. However, this is not the case with :.

: This is a comment that generates an error, ( if \[ $x -eq 3\] ).

The ":" serves as a [field](#FIELDREF) separator, in [/etc/passwd](#DATAFILESREF1), and in the [$PATH](#PATHREF) variable.

bash$ **echo $PATH**
/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/games

A _colon_ is [acceptable as a function name](#FSTRANGEREF).

:()
{
  echo "The name of this function is "$FUNCNAME" "
  # Why use a colon as a function name?
  # It's a way of obfuscating your code.
}

:

# The name of this function is :

This is not [portable](#PORTABILITYISSUES) behavior, and therefore not a recommended practice. In fact, more recent releases of Bash do not permit this usage. An underscore **\_** works, though.

A _colon_ can serve as a placeholder in an otherwise empty function.

not\_empty ()
{
  :
} # Contains a : (null command), and so is not empty.

!

**reverse (or negate) the sense of a test or exit status \[bang\].** The ! operator inverts the [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) of the command to which it is applied (see [Example 6-2](#NEGCOND)). It also inverts the meaning of a test operator. This can, for example, change the sense of _equal_ ( [\=](#EQUALSIGNREF) ) to _not-equal_ ( != ). The ! operator is a Bash [keyword](#KEYWORDREF).

In a different context, the ! also appears in [indirect variable references](#IVRREF).

In yet another context, from the _command line_, the ! invokes the Bash _history mechanism_ (see [Appendix L](#HISTCOMMANDS)). Note that within a script, the history mechanism is disabled.

\*

**wild card \[asterisk\].** The \* character serves as a "wild card" for filename expansion in [globbing](#GLOBBINGREF). By itself, it matches every filename in a given directory.

bash$ **echo \***
abs-book.sgml add-drive.sh agram.sh alias.sh
	      

The \* also represents [any number (or zero) characters](#ASTERISKREG) in a [regular expression](#REGEXREF).

\*

**[arithmetic operator](#AROPS1).** In the context of arithmetic operations, the \* denotes multiplication.

\*\* A double asterisk can represent the [exponentiation](#EXPONENTIATIONREF) operator or [extended file-match](#GLOBSTARREF) _globbing_.

?

**test operator.** Within certain expressions, the ? indicates a test for a condition.

In a [double-parentheses construct](#DBLPARENS), the ? can serve as an element of a C-style _trinary_ operator. [\[17\]](#FTN.AEN888)

condition**?**result-if-true**:**result-if-false

(( var0 = var1<98?9:21 ))
#                ^ ^

# if \[ "$var1" -lt 98 \]
# then
#   var0=9
# else
#   var0=21
# fi

In a [parameter substitution](#PARAMSUBREF) expression, the ? [tests whether a variable has been set](#QERRMSG).

?

**wild card.** The ? character serves as a single-character "wild card" for filename expansion in [globbing](#GLOBBINGREF), as well as [representing one character](#QUEXREGEX) in an [extended regular expression](#EXTREGEX).

$

**[Variable substitution](#VARSUBN) (contents of a variable).**

var1=5
var2=23skidoo

echo $var1     # 5
echo $var2     # 23skidoo

A $ prefixing a variable name indicates the _value_ the variable holds.

$

**end-of-line.** In a [regular expression](#REGEXREF), a "$" addresses the [end of a line](#DOLLARSIGNREF) of text.

${}

**[Parameter substitution](#PARAMSUBREF).**

$' ... '

**[Quoted string expansion](#STRQ).** This construct expands single or multiple escaped octal or hex values into ASCII [\[18\]](#FTN.AEN1001) or [Unicode](#UNICODEREF) characters.

$\*, $@

**[positional parameters](#APPREF).**

$?

**exit status variable.** The [$? variable](#EXSREF) holds the [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) of a command, a [function](#FUNCTIONREF), or of the script itself.

$$

**process ID variable.** The [$$ variable](#PROCCID) holds the _process ID_ [\[19\]](#FTN.AEN1071) of the script in which it appears.

()

**command group.**

(a=hello; echo $a)

![Important](../images/important.gif)

A listing of commands within _parentheses_ starts a [subshell](#SUBSHELLSREF).

Variables inside parentheses, within the subshell, are not visible to the rest of the script. The parent process, the script, [cannot read variables created in the child process](#PARVIS), the subshell.

a=123
( a=321; )	      

echo "a = $a"   # a = 123
# "a" within parentheses acts like a local variable.

**array initialization.**

Array=(element1 element2 element3)

{xxx,yyy,zzz,...}

**Brace expansion.**

echo \\"{These,words,are,quoted}\\"   # " prefix and suffix
# "These" "words" "are" "quoted"


cat {file1,file2,file3} > combined\_file
# Concatenates the files file1, file2, and file3 into combined\_file.

cp file22.{txt,backup}
# Copies "file22.txt" to "file22.backup"

A command may act upon a comma-separated list of file specs within _braces_. [\[20\]](#FTN.AEN1124) Filename expansion ([globbing](#GLOBBINGREF)) applies to the file specs between the braces.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

No spaces allowed within the braces _unless_ the spaces are quoted or escaped.

**echo {file1,file2}\\ :{\\ A," B",' C'}**

file1 : A file1 : B file1 : C file2 : A file2 : B file2 : C

{a..z}

**Extended Brace expansion.**

echo {a..z} # a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
# Echoes characters between a and z.

echo {0..3} # 0 1 2 3
# Echoes characters between 0 and 3.


base64\_charset=( {A..Z} {a..z} {0..9} + / = )
# Initializing an array, using extended brace expansion.
# From vladz's "base64.sh" example script.

The _{a..z}_ [extended brace expansion](#BRACEEXPREF3) construction is a feature introduced in [version 3](#BASH3REF) of _Bash_.

{}

**Block of code \[curly brackets\].** Also referred to as an _inline group_, this construct, in effect, creates an _anonymous function_ (a function without a name). However, unlike in a "standard" [function](#FUNCTIONREF), the variables inside a code block remain visible to the remainder of the script.

bash$ **{ local a;
	      a=123; }**
bash: local: can only be used in a
function
	      

a=123
{ a=321; }
echo "a = $a"   # a = 321   (value inside code block)

# Thanks, S.C.

The code block enclosed in braces may have [I/O redirected](#IOREDIRREF) to and from it.

**Example 3-1. Code blocks and I/O redirection**

#!/bin/bash
# Reading lines in /etc/fstab.

File=/etc/fstab

{
read line1
read line2
} < $File

echo "First line in $File is:"
echo "$line1"
echo
echo "Second line in $File is:"
echo "$line2"

exit 0

# Now, how do you parse the separate fields of each line?
# Hint: use awk, or . . .
# . . . Hans-Joerg Diers suggests using the "set" Bash builtin.

**Example 3-2. Saving the output of a code block to a file**

#!/bin/bash
# rpm-check.sh

#  Queries an rpm file for description, listing,
#+ and whether it can be installed.
#  Saves output to a file.
# 
#  This script illustrates using a code block.

SUCCESS=0
E\_NOARGS=65

if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` rpm-file"
  exit $E\_NOARGS
fi  

{ # Begin code block.
  echo
  echo "Archive Description:"
  rpm -qpi $1       # Query description.
  echo
  echo "Archive Listing:"
  rpm -qpl $1       # Query listing.
  echo
  rpm -i --test $1  # Query whether rpm file can be installed.
  if \[ "$?" -eq $SUCCESS \]
  then
    echo "$1 can be installed."
  else
    echo "$1 cannot be installed."
  fi  
  echo              # End code block.
} > "$1.test"       # Redirects output of everything in block to file.

echo "Results of rpm test in file $1.test"

# See rpm man page for explanation of options.

exit 0

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Unlike a command group within (parentheses), as above, a code block enclosed by {braces} will _not_ normally launch a [subshell](#SUBSHELLSREF). [\[21\]](#FTN.AEN1199)

It is possible to [iterate](#ITERATIONREF) a code block using a [non-standard _for-loop_](#NODODONE).

{}

**placeholder for text.** Used after [xargs \-i](#XARGSCURLYREF) (_replace strings_ option). The {} double curly brackets are a placeholder for output text.

ls . | xargs -i -t cp ./{} $1
#            ^^         ^^

# From "ex42.sh" (copydir.sh) example.

{} \\;

**pathname.** Mostly used in [find](#FINDREF) constructs. This is _not_ a shell [builtin](#BUILTINREF).

Definition: A _pathname_ is a _filename_ that includes the complete [path](#PATHREF). As an example, /home/bozo/Notes/Thursday/schedule.txt. This is sometimes referred to as the _absolute path_.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The ";" ends the \-exec option of a **find** command sequence. It needs to be escaped to protect it from interpretation by the shell.

\[ \]

**test.**

[Test](#IFTHEN) expression between **\[ \]**. Note that **\[** is part of the shell _builtin_ [test](#TTESTREF) (and a synonym for it), _not_ a link to the external command /usr/bin/test.

\[\[ \]\]

**test.**

Test expression between \[\[ \]\]. More flexible than the single-bracket \[ \] test, this is a shell [keyword](#KEYWORDREF).

See the discussion on the [\[\[ ... \]\] construct](#DBLBRACKETS).

\[ \]

**array element.**

In the context of an [array](#ARRAYREF), brackets set off the numbering of each element of that array.

Array\[1\]=slot\_1
echo ${Array\[1\]}

\[ \]

**range of characters.**

As part of a [regular expression](#REGEXREF), brackets delineate a [range of characters](#BRACKETSREF) to match.

$\[ ... \]

**integer expansion.**

Evaluate integer expression between $\[ \].

a=3
b=7

echo $\[$a+$b\]   # 10
echo $\[$a\*$b\]   # 21

Note that this usage is _deprecated_, and has been replaced by the [(( ... ))](#DBLPARENS) construct.

(( ))

**integer expansion.**

Expand and evaluate integer expression between (( )).

See the discussion on the [(( ... )) construct](#DBLPARENS).

\> &> \>& \>> < <>

**[redirection](#IOREDIRREF).**

**scriptname >filename** redirects the output of scriptname to file filename. Overwrite filename if it already exists.

**command &>filename** redirects both the [stdout](#STDINOUTDEF) and the stderr of command to filename.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

This is useful for suppressing output when testing for a condition. For example, let us test whether a certain command exists.

bash$ **type bogus\_command &>/dev/null**

bash$ **echo $?**
1
                    

Or in a script:

command\_test () { type "$1" &>/dev/null; }
#                                      ^

cmd=rmdir            # Legitimate command.
command\_test $cmd; echo $?   # 0


cmd=bogus\_command    # Illegitimate command
command\_test $cmd; echo $?   # 1

**command >&2** redirects stdout of command to stderr.

**scriptname >>filename** appends the output of scriptname to file filename. If filename does not already exist, it is created.

**\[i\]<>filename** opens file filename for reading and writing, and assigns [file descriptor](#FDREF) i to it. If filename does not exist, it is created.

**[process substitution](#PROCESSSUBREF).**

**(command)>**

**<(command)**

[In a different context](#LTREF), the "<" and "\>" characters act as [string comparison operators](#SCOMPARISON1).

[In yet another context](#INTLT), the "<" and "\>" characters act as [integer comparison operators](#ICOMPARISON1). See also [Example 16-9](#EX45).

<<

**redirection used in a [here document](#HEREDOCREF).**

<<<

**redirection used in a [here string](#HERESTRINGSREF).**

<, \>

**[ASCII comparison](#LTREF).**

veg1=carrots
veg2=tomatoes

if \[\[ "$veg1" < "$veg2" \]\]
then
  echo "Although $veg1 precede $veg2 in the dictionary,"
  echo -n "this does not necessarily imply anything "
  echo "about my culinary preferences."
else
  echo "What kind of dictionary are you using, anyhow?"
fi

\\<, \\>

**[word boundary](#ANGLEBRAC) in a [regular expression](#REGEXREF).**

bash$ **grep '\\<the\\>' textfile**

|

**pipe.** Passes the output (stdout) of a previous command to the input (stdin) of the next one, or to the shell. This is a method of chaining commands together.

echo ls -l | sh
#  Passes the output of "echo ls -l" to the shell,
#+ with the same result as a simple "ls -l".


cat \*.lst | sort | uniq
# Merges and sorts all ".lst" files, then deletes duplicate lines.

A pipe, as a classic method of interprocess communication, sends the stdout of one [process](#PROCESSREF) to the stdin of another. In a typical case, a command, such as [cat](#CATREF) or [echo](#ECHOREF), pipes a stream of data to a _filter_, a command that transforms its input for processing. [\[22\]](#FTN.AEN1564)

**cat $filename1 $filename2 | grep $search\_word**

For an interesting note on the complexity of using UNIX pipes, see [the UNIX FAQ, Part 3](http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/faq/part3/).

The output of a command or commands may be piped to a script.

#!/bin/bash
# uppercase.sh : Changes input to uppercase.

tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
#  Letter ranges must be quoted
#+ to prevent filename generation from single-letter filenames.

exit 0

Now, let us pipe the output of **ls -l** to this script.

bash$ **ls -l | ./uppercase.sh**
\-RW-RW-R--    1 BOZO  BOZO       109 APR  7 19:49 1.TXT
 -RW-RW-R--    1 BOZO  BOZO       109 APR 14 16:48 2.TXT
 -RW-R--R--    1 BOZO  BOZO       725 APR 20 20:56 DATA-FILE
	      

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The stdout of each process in a pipe must be read as the stdin of the next. If this is not the case, the data stream will _block_, and the pipe will not behave as expected.

cat file1 file2 | ls -l | sort
# The output from "cat file1 file2" disappears.

A pipe runs as a [child process](#CHILDREF), and therefore cannot alter script variables.

variable="initial\_value"
echo "new\_value" | read variable
echo "variable = $variable"     # variable = initial\_value

If one of the commands in the pipe aborts, this prematurely terminates execution of the pipe. Called a _broken pipe_, this condition sends a _SIGPIPE_ [signal](#SIGNALD).

\>|

**force redirection (even if the [noclobber option](#NOCLOBBERREF) is set).** This will forcibly overwrite an existing file.

||

**[OR logical operator](#ORREF).** In a [test construct](#TESTCONSTRUCTS1), the || operator causes a return of 0 (success) if _either_ of the linked test conditions is true.

&

**Run job in background.** A command followed by an & will run in the background.

bash$ **sleep 10 &**
\[1\] 850
\[1\]+  Done                    sleep 10
	      

Within a script, commands and even [loops](#FORLOOPREF1) may run in the background.

**Example 3-3. Running a loop in the background**

#!/bin/bash
# background-loop.sh

for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10            # First loop.
do
  echo -n "$i "
done & # Run this loop in background.
       # Will sometimes execute after second loop.

echo   # This 'echo' sometimes will not display.

for i in 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   # Second loop.
do
  echo -n "$i "
done  

echo   # This 'echo' sometimes will not display.

# ======================================================

# The expected output from the script:
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
# 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 

# Sometimes, though, you get:
# 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 bozo $
# (The second 'echo' doesn't execute. Why?)

# Occasionally also:
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
# (The first 'echo' doesn't execute. Why?)

# Very rarely something like:
# 11 12 13 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
# The foreground loop preempts the background one.

exit 0

#  Nasimuddin Ansari suggests adding    sleep 1
#+ after the   echo -n "$i"   in lines 6 and 14,
#+ for some real fun.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

A command run in the background within a script may cause the script to hang, waiting for a keystroke. Fortunately, there is a [remedy](#WAITHANG) for this.

&&

**[AND logical operator](#LOGOPS1).** In a [test construct](#TESTCONSTRUCTS1), the && operator causes a return of 0 (success) only if _both_ the linked test conditions are true.

\-

**option, prefix.** Option flag for a command or filter. Prefix for an operator. Prefix for a [default parameter](#DEFPARAM1) in [parameter substitution](#PARAMSUBREF).

**COMMAND -\[Option1\]\[Option2\]\[...\]**

**ls -al**

**sort -dfu $filename**

if \[ $file1 -ot $file2 \]
then #      ^
  echo "File $file1 is older than $file2."
fi

if \[ "$a" -eq "$b" \]
then #    ^
  echo "$a is equal to $b."
fi

if \[ "$c" -eq 24 -a "$d" -eq 47 \]
then #    ^              ^
  echo "$c equals 24 and $d equals 47."
fi


param2=${param1:-$DEFAULTVAL}
#               ^

**\--**

The _double-dash_ \-- prefixes _long_ (verbatim) options to commands.

**sort --ignore-leading-blanks**

Used with a [Bash builtin](#BUILTINREF), it means the _end of options_ to that particular command.

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

This provides a handy means of removing files whose _names begin with a dash_.

bash$ **ls -l**
\-rw-r--r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Nov 25 12:29 -badname

bash$ **rm -- -badname**

bash$ **ls -l**
total 0

The _double-dash_ is also used in conjunction with [set](#SETREF).

**set -- $variable** (as in [Example 15-18](#SETPOS))

\-

**redirection from/to stdin or stdout \[dash\].**

bash$ **cat -**
**abc**
abc

...

**Ctl-D**

As expected, **cat -** echoes stdin, in this case keyboarded user input, to stdout. But, does I/O redirection using **\-** have real-world applications?

#   tar cf - . | (cd ../dest/directory; tar xpvf -)
#
#     Also having same effect:
# cp -a /source/directory/\* /dest/directory
#     Or:
# cp -a /source/directory/\* /source/directory/.\[^.\]\* /dest/directory
#     If there are hidden files in /source/directory.

bunzip2 -c linux-2.6.16.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
#  --uncompress tar file--      | --then pass it to "tar"--
#  If "tar" has not been patched to handle "bunzip2",
#+ this needs to be done in two discrete steps, using a pipe.
#  The purpose of the exercise is to unarchive "bzipped" kernel source.

Note that in this context the "-" is not itself a Bash operator, but rather an option recognized by certain UNIX utilities that write to stdout, such as **tar**, **cat**, etc.

bash$ **echo "whatever" | cat -**
whatever 

Where a filename is expected, _\-_ redirects output to stdout (sometimes seen with **tar cf**), or accepts input from stdin, rather than from a file. This is a method of using a file-oriented utility as a filter in a pipe.

bash$ **file**
Usage: file \[-bciknvzL\] \[-f namefile\] \[-m magicfiles\] file...
	      

By itself on the command-line, [file](#FILEREF) fails with an error message.

Add a "-" for a more useful result. This causes the shell to await user input.

bash$ **file -**
**abc**
standard input:              ASCII text

bash$ **file -**
**#!/bin/bash**
standard input:              Bourne-Again shell script text executable
	      

Now the command accepts input from stdin and analyzes it.

The "-" can be used to pipe stdout to other commands. This permits such stunts as [prepending lines to a file](#PREPENDREF).

Using [diff](#DIFFREF) to compare a file with a _section_ of another:

**grep Linux file1 | diff file2 -**

Finally, a real-world example using _\-_ with [tar](#TARREF).

**Example 3-4. Backup of all files changed in last day**

#!/bin/bash

#  Backs up all files in current directory modified within last 24 hours
#+ in a "tarball" (tarred and gzipped file).

BACKUPFILE=backup-$(date +%m-%d-%Y)
#                 Embeds date in backup filename.
#                 Thanks, Joshua Tschida, for the idea.
archive=${1:-$BACKUPFILE}
#  If no backup-archive filename specified on command-line,
#+ it will default to "backup-MM-DD-YYYY.tar.gz."

tar cvf - \`find . -mtime -1 -type f -print\` > $archive.tar
gzip $archive.tar
echo "Directory $PWD backed up in archive file \\"$archive.tar.gz\\"."


#  Stephane Chazelas points out that the above code will fail
#+ if there are too many files found
#+ or if any filenames contain blank characters.

# He suggests the following alternatives:
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
#   find . -mtime -1 -type f -print0 | xargs -0 tar rvf "$archive.tar"
#      using the GNU version of "find".


#   find . -mtime -1 -type f -exec tar rvf "$archive.tar" '{}' \\;
#         portable to other UNIX flavors, but much slower.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Filenames beginning with "-" may cause problems when coupled with the "-" redirection operator. A script should check for this and add an appropriate prefix to such filenames, for example ./-FILENAME, $PWD/-FILENAME, or $PATHNAME/-FILENAME.

If the value of a variable begins with a _\-_, this may likewise create problems.

var="-n"
echo $var		
# Has the effect of "echo -n", and outputs nothing.

\-

**previous working directory.** A **cd -** command changes to the previous working directory. This uses the [$OLDPWD](#OLDPWD) [environmental variable](#ENVREF).

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Do not confuse the "-" used in this sense with the "-" redirection operator just discussed. The interpretation of the "-" depends on the context in which it appears.

\-

**Minus.** Minus sign in an [arithmetic operation](#AROPS1).

\=

**Equals.** [Assignment operator](#EQREF)

a=28
echo $a   # 28

In a [different context](#EQUALSIGNREF), the "\=" is a [string comparison](#SCOMPARISON1) operator.

+

**Plus.** Addition [arithmetic operator](#AROPS1).

In a [different context](#PLUSREF), the + is a [Regular Expression](#REGEXP) operator.

+

**Option.** Option flag for a command or filter.

Certain commands and [builtins](#BUILTINREF) use the + to enable certain options and the \- to disable them. In [parameter substitution](#PARAMSUBREF), the + prefixes an [alternate value](#PARAMALTV) that a variable expands to.

%

**[modulo](#MODULOREF).** Modulo (remainder of a division) [arithmetic operation](#AROPS1).

let "z = 5 % 3"
echo $z  # 2

In a [different context](#PCTPATREF), the % is a [pattern matching](#PSUB2) operator.

~

**home directory \[tilde\].** This corresponds to the [$HOME](#HOMEDIRREF) internal variable. ~bozo is bozo's home directory, and **ls ~bozo** lists the contents of it. ~/ is the current user's home directory, and **ls ~/** lists the contents of it.

bash$ **echo ~bozo**
/home/bozo

bash$ **echo ~**
/home/bozo

bash$ **echo ~/**
/home/bozo/

bash$ **echo ~:**
/home/bozo:

**current working directory.** This corresponds to the [$PWD](#PWDREF) internal variable.

~-

**previous working directory.** This corresponds to the [$OLDPWD](#OLDPWD) internal variable.

\=~

**[regular expression match](#REGEXMATCHREF).** This operator was introduced with [version 3](#BASH3REF) of Bash.

**[Uppercase conversion](#CASEMODPARAMSUB) in _parameter substitution_ (added in [version 4](#BASH4REF) of Bash).**

Control Characters

**change the behavior of the terminal or text display.** A control character is a **CONTROL** + **key** combination (pressed simultaneously). A control character may also be written in _octal_ or _hexadecimal_ notation, following an _escape_.

Control characters are not normally useful inside a script.

*   **Ctl-A**
    
    Moves cursor to beginning of line of text (on the command-line).
    
*   **Ctl-B**
    
    **Backspace** (nondestructive).
    
*   **Ctl-C**
    
    **Break**. Terminate a foreground job.
    
*   **Ctl-D**
    
    _Log out_ from a shell (similar to [exit](#EXITCOMMANDREF)).
    
    **EOF** (end-of-file). This also terminates input from stdin.
    
    When typing text on the console or in an _xterm_ window, **Ctl-D** erases the character under the cursor. When there are no characters present, **Ctl-D** logs out of the session, as expected. In an _xterm_ window, this has the effect of closing the window.
    
*   **Ctl-E**
    
    Moves cursor to end of line of text (on the command-line).
    
*   **Ctl-F**
    
    Moves cursor forward one character position (on the command-line).
    
*   **Ctl-G**
    
    **BEL**. On some old-time teletype terminals, this would actually ring a bell. In an _xterm_ it might beep.
    
*   **Ctl-H**
    
    **Rubout** (destructive backspace). Erases characters the cursor backs over while backspacing.
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # Embedding Ctl-H in a string.
    
    a="^H^H"                  # Two Ctl-H's -- backspaces
                              # ctl-V ctl-H, using vi/vim
    echo "abcdef"             # abcdef
    echo
    echo -n "abcdef$a "       # abcd f
    #  Space at end  ^              ^  Backspaces twice.
    echo
    echo -n "abcdef$a"        # abcdef
    #  No space at end               ^ Doesn't backspace (why?).
                              # Results may not be quite as expected.
    echo; echo
    
    # Constantin Hagemeier suggests trying:
    # a=$'\\010\\010'
    # a=$'\\b\\b'
    # a=$'\\x08\\x08'
    # But, this does not change the results.
    
    ########################################
    
    # Now, try this.
    
    rubout="^H^H^H^H^H"       # 5 x Ctl-H.
    
    echo -n "12345678"
    sleep 2
    echo -n "$rubout"
    sleep 2
    
*   **Ctl-I**
    
    **Horizontal tab**.
    
*   **Ctl-J**
    
    **Newline** (line feed). In a script, may also be expressed in octal notation -- '\\012' or in hexadecimal -- '\\x0a'.
    
*   **Ctl-K**
    
    **Vertical tab**.
    
    When typing text on the console or in an _xterm_ window, **Ctl-K** erases from the character under the cursor to end of line. Within a script, **Ctl-K** may behave differently, as in Lee Lee Maschmeyer's example, below.
    
*   **Ctl-L**
    
    **Formfeed** (clear the terminal screen). In a terminal, this has the same effect as the [clear](#CLEARREF) command. When sent to a printer, a **Ctl-L** causes an advance to end of the paper sheet.
    
*   **Ctl-M**
    
    **Carriage return**.
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # Thank you, Lee Maschmeyer, for this example.
    
    read -n 1 -s -p \\
    $'Control-M leaves cursor at beginning of this line. Press Enter. \\x0d'
               # Of course, '0d' is the hex equivalent of Control-M.
    echo >&2   #  The '-s' makes anything typed silent,
               #+ so it is necessary to go to new line explicitly.
    
    read -n 1 -s -p $'Control-J leaves cursor on next line. \\x0a'
               #  '0a' is the hex equivalent of Control-J, linefeed.
    echo >&2
    
    ###
    
    read -n 1 -s -p $'And Control-K\\x0bgoes straight down.'
    echo >&2   #  Control-K is vertical tab.
    
    # A better example of the effect of a vertical tab is:
    
    var=$'\\x0aThis is the bottom line\\x0bThis is the top line\\x0a'
    echo "$var"
    #  This works the same way as the above example. However:
    echo "$var" | col
    #  This causes the right end of the line to be higher than the left end.
    #  It also explains why we started and ended with a line feed --
    #+ to avoid a garbled screen.
    
    # As Lee Maschmeyer explains:
    # --------------------------
    #  In the \[first vertical tab example\] . . . the vertical tab
    #+ makes the printing go straight down without a carriage return.
    #  This is true only on devices, such as the Linux console,
    #+ that can't go "backward."
    #  The real purpose of VT is to go straight UP, not down.
    #  It can be used to print superscripts on a printer.
    #  The col utility can be used to emulate the proper behavior of VT.
    
    exit 0
    
*   **Ctl-N**
    
    Erases a line of text recalled from _history buffer_ [\[23\]](#FTN.AEN2107) (on the command-line).
    
*   **Ctl-O**
    
    Issues a _newline_ (on the command-line).
    
*   **Ctl-P**
    
    Recalls last command from _history buffer_ (on the command-line).
    
*   **Ctl-Q**
    
    Resume (**XON**).
    
    This resumes stdin in a terminal.
    
*   **Ctl-R**
    
    Backwards search for text in _history buffer_ (on the command-line).
    
*   **Ctl-S**
    
    Suspend (**XOFF**).
    
    This freezes stdin in a terminal. (Use Ctl-Q to restore input.)
    
*   **Ctl-T**
    
    Reverses the position of the character the cursor is on with the previous character (on the command-line).
    
*   **Ctl-U**
    
    Erase a line of input, from the cursor backward to beginning of line. In some settings, **Ctl-U** erases the entire line of input, _regardless of cursor position_.
    
*   **Ctl-V**
    
    When inputting text, **Ctl-V** permits inserting control characters. For example, the following two are equivalent:
    
    echo -e '\\x0a'
    echo <Ctl-V><Ctl-J>
    
    **Ctl-V** is primarily useful from within a text editor.
    
*   **Ctl-W**
    
    When typing text on the console or in an xterm window, **Ctl-W** erases from the character under the cursor backwards to the first instance of [whitespace](#WHITESPACEREF). In some settings, **Ctl-W** erases backwards to first non-alphanumeric character.
    
*   **Ctl-X**
    
    In certain word processing programs, _Cuts_ highlighted text and copies to _clipboard_.
    
*   **Ctl-Y**
    
    _Pastes_ back text previously erased (with **Ctl-U** or **Ctl-W**).
    
*   **Ctl-Z**
    
    _Pauses_ a foreground job.
    
    _Substitute_ operation in certain word processing applications.
    
    **EOF** (end-of-file) character in the MSDOS filesystem.
    

Whitespace

**functions as a separator between commands and/or variables.** Whitespace consists of either _spaces_, _tabs_, _blank lines_, or any combination thereof. [\[24\]](#FTN.AEN2198) In some contexts, such as [variable assignment](#WSBAD), whitespace is not permitted, and results in a syntax error.

Blank lines have no effect on the action of a script, and are therefore useful for visually separating functional sections.

[$IFS](#IFSREF), the special variable separating _fields_ of input to certain commands. It defaults to whitespace.

**Definition:** A _field_ is a discrete chunk of data expressed as a string of consecutive characters. Separating each field from adjacent fields is either _whitespace_ or some other designated character (often determined by the $IFS). In some contexts, a field may be called a _record_.

To preserve _whitespace_ within a string or in a variable, use [quoting](#QUOTINGREF).

UNIX [filters](#FILTERDEF) can target and operate on _whitespace_ using the [POSIX](#POSIXREF) character class [\[:space:\]](#WSPOSIX).

Chapter 4. Introduction to Variables and Parameters
===================================================

_Variables_ are how programming and scripting languages represent data. A variable is nothing more than a _label_, a name assigned to a location or set of locations in computer memory holding an item of data.

Variables appear in arithmetic operations and manipulation of quantities, and in string parsing.

* * *

4.1. Variable Substitution
==========================

The _name_ of a variable is a placeholder for its _value_, the data it holds. Referencing (retrieving) its value is called _variable substitution_.

$

Let us carefully distinguish between the _name_ of a variable and its _value_. If **variable1** is the name of a variable, then **$variable1** is a reference to its _value_, the data item it contains. [\[25\]](#FTN.AEN2258)

bash$ **variable1=23**

bash$ **echo variable1**
variable1

bash$ **echo $variable1**
23

The only times a variable appears "naked" -- without the $ prefix -- is when declared or assigned, when _unset_, when [exported](#EXPORTREF), in an arithmetic expression within [double parentheses (( ... ))](#DBLPARENS), or in the special case of a variable representing a [signal](#SIGNALD) (see [Example 32-5](#EX76)). Assignment may be with an \= (as in _var1=27_), in a [read](#READREF) statement, and at the head of a loop (_for var2 in 1 2 3_).

Enclosing a referenced value in _double quotes_ (" ... ") does not interfere with variable substitution. This is called _partial quoting_, sometimes referred to as "weak quoting." Using single quotes (' ... ') causes the variable name to be used literally, and no substitution will take place. This is _full quoting_, sometimes referred to as 'strong quoting.' See [Chapter 5](#QUOTING) for a detailed discussion.

Note that **$variable** is actually a simplified form of **${variable}**. In contexts where the **$variable** syntax causes an error, the longer form may work (see [Section 10.2](#PARAMETER-SUBSTITUTION), below).

**Example 4-1. Variable assignment and substitution**

#!/bin/bash
# ex9.sh

# Variables: assignment and substitution

#% Script tries to run "VARIABLE" command with one argument, "=value".

#  "VARIABLE= value"
#            ^
#% Script tries to run "value" command with
#+ the environmental variable "VARIABLE" set to "".
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------


echo hello    # hello
# Not a variable reference, just the string "hello" ...

echo $hello   # 375
#    ^          This \*is\* a variable reference.
echo ${hello} # 375
#               Likewise a variable reference, as above.

# Quoting . . .
echo "$hello"    # 375
echo "${hello}"  # 375

echo

hello="A B  C   D"
echo $hello   # A B C D
echo "$hello" # A B  C   D
# As we see, echo $hello   and   echo "$hello"   give different results.
# =======================================
# Quoting a variable preserves whitespace.
# =======================================

echo

echo '$hello'  # $hello
#    ^      ^
#  Variable referencing disabled (escaped) by single quotes,
#+ which causes the "$" to be interpreted literally.

# Notice the effect of different types of quoting.


hello=    # Setting it to a null value.
echo "\\$hello (null value) = $hello"      # $hello (null value) =
#  Note that setting a variable to a null value is not the same as
#+ unsetting it, although the end result is the same (see below).

# --------------------------------------------------------------

#  It is permissible to set multiple variables on the same line,
#+ if separated by white space.
#  Caution, this may reduce legibility, and may not be portable.

var1=21  var2=22  var3=$V3
echo
echo "var1=$var1   var2=$var2   var3=$var3"

# May cause problems with legacy versions of "sh" . . .

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

An uninitialized variable has a "null" value -- no assigned value at all (_not_ zero!).

if \[ -z "$unassigned" \]
then
  echo "\\$unassigned is NULL."
fi     # $unassigned is NULL.

Using a variable before assigning a value to it may cause problems. It is nevertheless possible to perform arithmetic operations on an uninitialized variable.

echo "$uninitialized"                                # (blank line)
let "uninitialized += 5"                             # Add 5 to it.
echo "$uninitialized"                                # 5

#  Conclusion:
#  An uninitialized variable has no value,
#+ however it evaluates as 0 in an arithmetic operation.

See also [Example 15-23](#SELFSOURCE).

* * *

4.2. Variable Assignment
========================

\=

the assignment operator (_no space before and after_)

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Do not confuse this with [\=](#EQUALSIGNREF) and [\-eq](#EQUALREF), which [test](#IFTHEN), rather than assign!

Note that \= can be either an _assignment_ or a _test_ operator, depending on context.

**Example 4-2. Plain Variable Assignment**

#!/bin/bash
# Naked variables

echo

# When is a variable "naked", i.e., lacking the '$' in front?
# When it is being assigned, rather than referenced.

# Assignment
a=879
echo "The value of \\"a\\" is $a."

# Assignment using 'let'
let a=16+5
echo "The value of \\"a\\" is now $a."

echo

# In a 'for' loop (really, a type of disguised assignment):
echo -n "Values of \\"a\\" in the loop are: "
for a in 7 8 9 11
do
  echo -n "$a "
done

echo
echo

# In a 'read' statement (also a type of assignment):
echo -n "Enter \\"a\\" "
read a
echo "The value of \\"a\\" is now $a."

echo

exit 0

**Example 4-3. Variable Assignment, plain and fancy**

#!/bin/bash

a=23              # Simple case
echo $a
b=$a
echo $b

# Now, getting a little bit fancier (command substitution).

a=\`echo Hello!\`   # Assigns result of 'echo' command to 'a' ...
echo $a
#  Note that including an exclamation mark (!) within a
#+ command substitution construct will not work from the command-line,
#+ since this triggers the Bash "history mechanism."
#  Inside a script, however, the history functions are disabled by default.

a=\`ls -l\`         # Assigns result of 'ls -l' command to 'a'
echo $a           # Unquoted, however, it removes tabs and newlines.
echo
echo "$a"         # The quoted variable preserves whitespace.
                  # (See the chapter on "Quoting.")

exit 0

Variable assignment using the _$(...)_ mechanism (a newer method than [backquotes](#BACKQUOTESREF)). This is likewise a form of [command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF).

4.3. Bash Variables Are Untyped
===============================

Unlike many other programming languages, Bash does not segregate its variables by "type." Essentially, _Bash variables are character strings_, but, depending on context, Bash permits arithmetic operations and comparisons on variables. The determining factor is whether the value of a variable contains only digits.

**Example 4-4. Integer or string?**

#!/bin/bash
# int-or-string.sh

a=2334                   # Integer.
let "a += 1"
echo "a = $a "           # a = 2335
echo                     # Integer, still.


b=${a/23/BB}             # Substitute "BB" for "23".
                         # This transforms $b into a string.
echo "b = $b"            # b = BB35
declare -i b             # Declaring it an integer doesn't help.
echo "b = $b"            # b = BB35

let "b += 1"             # BB35 + 1
echo "b = $b"            # b = 1
echo                     # Bash sets the "integer value" of a string to 0.

c=BB34
echo "c = $c"            # c = BB34
d=${c/BB/23}             # Substitute "23" for "BB".
                         # This makes $d an integer.
echo "d = $d"            # d = 2334
let "d += 1"             # 2334 + 1
echo "d = $d"            # d = 2335
echo


# What about null variables?
e=''                     # ... Or e="" ... Or e=

exit $?

Untyped variables are both a blessing and a curse. They permit more flexibility in scripting and make it easier to grind out lines of code (and give you enough rope to hang yourself!). However, they likewise permit subtle errors to creep in and encourage sloppy programming habits.

To lighten the burden of keeping track of variable types in a script, Bash _does_ permit [declaring](#DECLAREREF) variables.

4.4. Special Variable Types
===========================

_Local variables_

Variables [visible](#SCOPEREF) only within a [code block](#CODEBLOCKREF) or function (see also [local variables](#LOCALREF) in [functions](#FUNCTIONREF))

_Environmental variables_

Variables that affect the behavior of the shell and user interface

![Note](../images/note.gif)

In a more general context, each [process](#PROCESSREF) has an "environment", that is, a group of variables that the process may reference. In this sense, the shell behaves like any other process.

Every time a shell starts, it creates shell variables that correspond to its own environmental variables. Updating or adding new environmental variables causes the shell to update its environment, and all the shell's _child processes_ (the commands it executes) inherit this environment.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

The space allotted to the environment is limited. Creating too many environmental variables or ones that use up excessive space may cause problems.

bash$ **eval "\`seq 10000 | sed -e 's/.\*/export var&=ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ/'\`"**

bash$ **du**
bash: /usr/bin/du: Argument list too long
	          

Note: this "error" has been fixed, as of kernel version 2.6.23.

(Thank you, StÃ©phane Chazelas for the clarification, and for providing the above example.)

If a script sets environmental variables, they need to be "exported," that is, reported to the _environment_ local to the script. This is the function of the [export](#EXPORTREF) command.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

A script can **export** variables only to child [processes](#PROCESSREF), that is, only to commands or processes which that particular script initiates. A script invoked from the command-line _cannot_ export variables back to the command-line environment. _[Child processes](#FORKREF) cannot export variables back to the parent processes that spawned them._

**Definition:** A _child process_ is a subprocess launched by another process, its [parent](#PARENTREF).

_Positional parameters_

Arguments passed to the script from the command line [\[26\]](#FTN.AEN2450) : $0, $1, $2, $3 . . .

$0 is the name of the script itself, $1 is the first argument, $2 the second, $3 the third, and so forth. [\[27\]](#FTN.AEN2464) After $9, the arguments must be enclosed in brackets, for example, ${10}, ${11}, ${12}.

The special variables [$\* and $@](#APPREF) denote _all_ the positional parameters.

**Example 4-5. Positional Parameters**

#!/bin/bash

# Call this script with at least 10 parameters, for example
# ./scriptname 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
MINPARAMS=10

echo

echo "The name of this script is \\"$0\\"."
# Adds ./ for current directory
echo "The name of this script is \\"\`basename $0\`\\"."
# Strips out path name info (see 'basename')

echo

if \[ -n "$1" \]              # Tested variable is quoted.
then
 echo "Parameter #1 is $1"  # Need quotes to escape #
fi 

if \[ -n "$2" \]
then
 echo "Parameter #2 is $2"
fi 

if \[ -n "$3" \]
then
 echo "Parameter #3 is $3"
fi 

# ...


if \[ -n "${10}" \]  # Parameters > $9 must be enclosed in {brackets}.
then
 echo "Parameter #10 is ${10}"
fi 

echo "-----------------------------------"
echo "All the command-line parameters are: "$\*""

if \[ $# -lt "$MINPARAMS" \]
then
  echo
  echo "This script needs at least $MINPARAMS command-line arguments!"
fi  

echo

exit 0

_Bracket notation_ for positional parameters leads to a fairly simple way of referencing the _last_ argument passed to a script on the command-line. This also requires [indirect referencing](#VARREFNEW).

args=$#           # Number of args passed.
lastarg=${!args}
# Note: This is an \*indirect reference\* to $args ...


# Or:       lastarg=${!#}             (Thanks, Chris Monson.)
# This is an \*indirect reference\* to the $# variable.
# Note that lastarg=${!$#} doesn't work.

Some scripts can perform different operations, depending on which name they are invoked with. For this to work, the script needs to check $0, the name it was invoked by. [\[28\]](#FTN.AEN2501) There must also exist symbolic links to all the alternate names of the script. See [Example 16-2](#HELLOL).

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

If a script expects a command-line parameter but is invoked without one, this may cause a _null variable assignment_, generally an undesirable result. One way to prevent this is to append an extra character to both sides of the assignment statement using the expected positional parameter.

variable1\_=$1\_  # Rather than variable1=$1
# This will prevent an error, even if positional parameter is absent.

critical\_argument01=$variable1\_

# The extra character can be stripped off later, like so.
variable1=${variable1\_/\_/}
# Side effects only if $variable1\_ begins with an underscore.
# This uses one of the parameter substitution templates discussed later.
# (Leaving out the replacement pattern results in a deletion.)

#  A more straightforward way of dealing with this is
#+ to simply test whether expected positional parameters have been passed.
if \[ -z $1 \]
then
  exit $E\_MISSING\_POS\_PARAM
fi


#  However, as Fabian Kreutz points out,
#+ the above method may have unexpected side-effects.
#  A better method is parameter substitution:
#         ${1:-$DefaultVal}
#  See the "Parameter Substition" section
#+ in the "Variables Revisited" chapter.

**Example 4-6. _wh_, _whois_ domain name lookup**

#!/bin/bash
# ex18.sh

# Does a 'whois domain-name' lookup on any of 3 alternate servers:
#                    ripe.net, cw.net, radb.net

# Place this script -- renamed 'wh' -- in /usr/local/bin

# Requires symbolic links:
# ln -s /usr/local/bin/wh /usr/local/bin/wh-ripe
# ln -s /usr/local/bin/wh /usr/local/bin/wh-apnic
# ln -s /usr/local/bin/wh /usr/local/bin/wh-tucows

E\_NOARGS=75


if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` \[domain-name\]"
  exit $E\_NOARGS
fi

# Check script name and call proper server.
case \`basename $0\` in    # Or:    case ${0##\*/} in
    "wh"       ) whois $1@whois.tucows.com;;
    "wh-ripe"  ) whois $1@whois.ripe.net;;
    "wh-apnic" ) whois $1@whois.apnic.net;;
    "wh-cw"    ) whois $1@whois.cw.net;;
    \*          ) echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` \[domain-name\]";;
esac 

exit $?

\---

The **shift** command reassigns the positional parameters, in effect shifting them to the left one notch.

$1 <--- $2, $2 <--- $3, $3 <--- $4, etc.

The old $1 disappears, but _$0 (the script name) does not change_. If you use a large number of positional parameters to a script, **shift** lets you access those past 10, although [{bracket} notation](#BRACKETNOTATION) also permits this.

**Example 4-7. Using _shift_**

#!/bin/bash
# shft.sh: Using 'shift' to step through all the positional parameters.

#  Name this script something like shft.sh,
#+ and invoke it with some parameters.
#+ For example:
#             sh shft.sh a b c def 83 barndoor

until \[ -z "$1" \]  # Until all parameters used up . . .
do
  echo -n "$1 "
  shift
done

echo               # Extra linefeed.

# But, what happens to the "used-up" parameters?
echo "$2"
#  Nothing echoes!
#  When $2 shifts into $1 (and there is no $3 to shift into $2)
#+ then $2 remains empty.
#  So, it is not a parameter \*copy\*, but a \*move\*.

exit

#  See also the echo-params.sh script for a "shiftless"
#+ alternative method of stepping through the positional params.

The **shift** command can take a numerical parameter indicating how many positions to shift.

#!/bin/bash
# shift-past.sh

shift 3    # Shift 3 positions.
#  n=3; shift $n
#  Has the same effect.

echo "$1"

exit 0

# ======================== #


$ sh shift-past.sh 1 2 3 4 5
4

#  However, as Eleni Fragkiadaki, points out,
#+ attempting a 'shift' past the number of
#+ positional parameters ($#) returns an exit status of 1,
#+ and the positional parameters themselves do not change.
#  This means possibly getting stuck in an endless loop. . . .
#  For example:
#      until \[ -z "$1" \]
#      do
#         echo -n "$1 "
#         shift 20    #  If less than 20 pos params,
#      done           #+ then loop never ends!
#
# When in doubt, add a sanity check. . . .
#           shift 20 || break
#                    ^^^^^^^^

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The **shift** command works in a similar fashion on parameters passed to a [function](#FUNCTIONREF). See [Example 36-18](#MULTIPLICATION).

* * *

Chapter 5. Quoting
==================

Quoting means just that, bracketing a string in quotes. This has the effect of protecting [special characters](#SCHARLIST1) in the string from reinterpretation or expansion by the shell or shell script. (A character is "special" if it has an interpretation other than its literal meaning. For example, the [asterisk \*](#ASTERISKREF) represents a _wild card_ character in [globbing](#GLOBBINGREF) and [Regular Expressions](#REGEXREF)).

bash$ **ls -l \[Vv\]\***
\-rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo       324 Apr  2 15:05 VIEWDATA.BAT
 -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo       507 May  4 14:25 vartrace.sh
 -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo       539 Apr 14 17:11 viewdata.sh

bash$ **ls -l '\[Vv\]\*'**
ls: \[Vv\]\*: No such file or directory

In everyday speech or writing, when we "quote" a phrase, we set it apart and give it special meaning. In a Bash script, when we _quote_ a string, we set it apart and protect its _literal_ meaning.

Certain programs and utilities reinterpret or expand special characters in a quoted string. An important use of quoting is protecting a command-line parameter from the shell, but still letting the calling program expand it.

bash$ **grep '\[Ff\]irst' \*.txt**
file1.txt:This is the first line of file1.txt.
 file2.txt:This is the First line of file2.txt.

Note that the unquoted **grep \[Ff\]irst \*.txt** works under the Bash shell. [\[29\]](#FTN.AEN2609)

Quoting can also suppress [echo's](#ECHOREF) "appetite" for newlines.

bash$ **echo $(ls -l)**
total 8 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bo bo 13 Aug 21 12:57 t.sh -rw-rw-r-- 1 bo bo 78 Aug 21 12:57 u.sh

bash$ **echo "$(ls -l)"**
total 8
 -rw-rw-r--  1 bo bo  13 Aug 21 12:57 t.sh
 -rw-rw-r--  1 bo bo  78 Aug 21 12:57 u.sh

* * *

5.1. Quoting Variables
======================

When referencing a variable, it is generally advisable to enclose its name in double quotes. This prevents reinterpretation of all special characters within the quoted string -- except $, \` (backquote), and \\ (escape). [\[30\]](#FTN.AEN2630) Keeping $ as a special character within double quotes permits referencing a quoted variable (_"$variable"_), that is, replacing the variable with its value (see [Example 4-1](#EX9), above).

Use double quotes to prevent word splitting. [\[31\]](#FTN.AEN2688) An argument enclosed in double quotes presents itself as a single word, even if it contains [whitespace](#WHITESPACEREF) separators.

List="one two three"

for a in $List     # Splits the variable in parts at whitespace.
do
  echo "$a"
done
# one
# two
# three

echo "---"

for a in "$List"   # Preserves whitespace in a single variable.
do #     ^     ^
  echo "$a"
done
# one two three

A more elaborate example:

variable1="a variable containing five words"
COMMAND This is $variable1    # Executes COMMAND with 7 arguments:
# "This" "is" "a" "variable" "containing" "five" "words"

COMMAND "This is $variable1"  # Executes COMMAND with 1 argument:
# "This is a variable containing five words"


variable2=""    # Empty.

COMMAND $variable2 $variable2 $variable2
                # Executes COMMAND with no arguments. 
COMMAND "$variable2" "$variable2" "$variable2"
                # Executes COMMAND with 3 empty arguments. 
COMMAND "$variable2 $variable2 $variable2"
                # Executes COMMAND with 1 argument (2 spaces). 

# Thanks, StÃ©phane Chazelas.

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

Enclosing the arguments to an **echo** statement in double quotes is necessary only when word splitting or preservation of [whitespace](#WHITESPACEREF) is an issue.

**Example 5-1. Echoing Weird Variables**

#!/bin/bash
# weirdvars.sh: Echoing weird variables.

echo

var="'(\]\\\\{}\\$\\""
echo $var        # '(\]\\{}$"
echo "$var"      # '(\]\\{}$"     Doesn't make a difference.

echo

IFS='\\'
echo $var        # '(\] {}$"     \\ converted to space. Why?
echo "$var"      # '(\]\\{}$"

# Examples above supplied by Stephane Chazelas.

echo

var2="\\\\\\\\\\""
echo $var2       #   "
echo "$var2"     # \\\\"
echo
# But ... var2="\\\\\\\\"" is illegal. Why?
var3='\\\\\\\\'
echo "$var3"     # \\\\\\\\
# Strong quoting works, though.


# \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* #
# As the first example above shows, nesting quotes is permitted.

echo "$(echo '"')"           # "
#    ^           ^


# At times this comes in useful.

var1="Two bits"
echo "\\$var1 = "$var1""      # $var1 = Two bits
#    ^                ^

# Or, as Chris Hiestand points out ...

if \[\[ "$(du "$My\_File1")" -gt "$(du "$My\_File2")" \]\]
#     ^     ^         ^ ^     ^     ^         ^ ^
then
  ...
fi
# \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* #

Single quotes (' ') operate similarly to double quotes, but do not permit referencing variables, since the special meaning of $ is turned off. Within single quotes, _every_ special character except ' gets interpreted literally. Consider single quotes ("full quoting") to be a stricter method of quoting than double quotes ("partial quoting").

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Since even the escape character (\\) gets a literal interpretation within single quotes, trying to enclose a single quote within single quotes will not yield the expected result.

echo "Why can't I write 's between single quotes"

echo

# The roundabout method.
echo 'Why can'\\''t I write '"'"'s between single quotes'
#    |-------|  |----------|   |-----------------------|
# Three single-quoted strings, with escaped and quoted single quotes between.

# This example courtesy of StÃ©phane Chazelas.

* * *

5.2. Escaping
=============

_Escaping_ is a method of quoting single characters. The escape (\\) preceding a character tells the shell to interpret that character literally.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

With certain commands and utilities, such as [echo](#ECHOREF) and [sed](#SEDREF), escaping a character may have the opposite effect - it can toggle on a special meaning for that character.

**Special meanings of certain escaped characters**

used with **echo** and **sed**

\\n

means newline

\\r

means return

\\t

means tab

\\v

means vertical tab

\\b

means backspace

\\a

means _alert_ (beep or flash)

\\0xx

translates to the octal [ASCII](#ASCIIDEF) equivalent of _0nn_, where _nn_ is a string of digits

![Important](../images/important.gif)

The **$' ... '** [quoted](#QUOTINGREF) string-expansion construct is a mechanism that uses escaped octal or hex values to assign ASCII characters to variables, e.g., **quote=$'\\042'**.

**Example 5-2. Escaped Characters**

#!/bin/bash
# escaped.sh: escaped characters

#############################################################
### First, let's show some basic escaped-character usage. ###
#############################################################

# Escaping a newline.
# ------------------

echo ""

echo "This will print
as two lines."
# This will print
# as two lines.

echo "This will print \\
as one line."
# This will print as one line.

echo; echo

echo "============="


echo "\\v\\v\\v\\v"      # Prints \\v\\v\\v\\v literally.
# Use the -e option with 'echo' to print escaped characters.
echo "============="
echo "VERTICAL TABS"
echo -e "\\v\\v\\v\\v"   # Prints 4 vertical tabs.
echo "=============="

echo "QUOTATION MARK"
echo -e "\\042"       # Prints " (quote, octal ASCII character 42).
echo "=============="



# The $'\\X' construct makes the -e option unnecessary.

echo; echo "NEWLINE and (maybe) BEEP"
echo $'\\n'           # Newline.
echo $'\\a'           # Alert (beep).
                     # May only flash, not beep, depending on terminal.

# We have seen $'\\nnn" string expansion, and now . . .

# =================================================================== #
# Version 2 of Bash introduced the $'\\nnn' string expansion construct.
# =================================================================== #

echo "Introducing the \\$\\' ... \\' string-expansion construct . . . "
echo ". . . featuring more quotation marks."

echo $'\\t \\042 \\t'   # Quote (") framed by tabs.
# Note that  '\\nnn' is an octal value.

# It also works with hexadecimal values, in an $'\\xhhh' construct.
echo $'\\t \\x22 \\t'  # Quote (") framed by tabs.
# Thank you, Greg Keraunen, for pointing this out.
# Earlier Bash versions allowed '\\x022'.

echo


# Assigning ASCII characters to a variable.
# ----------------------------------------
quote=$'\\042'        # " assigned to a variable.
echo "$quote Quoted string $quote and this lies outside the quotes."

echo

# Concatenating ASCII chars in a variable.
triple\_underline=$'\\137\\137\\137'  # 137 is octal ASCII code for '\_'.
echo "$triple\_underline UNDERLINE $triple\_underline"

echo

ABC=$'\\101\\102\\103\\010'           # 101, 102, 103 are octal A, B, C.
echo $ABC

echo

escape=$'\\033'                    # 033 is octal for escape.
echo "\\"escape\\" echoes as $escape"
#                                   no visible output.

Elements of a string assigned to a variable may be escaped, but the escape character alone may not be assigned to a variable.

variable=\\
echo "$variable"
# Will not work - gives an error message:
# test.sh: : command not found
# A "naked" escape cannot safely be assigned to a variable.
#
#  What actually happens here is that the "\\" escapes the newline and
#+ the effect is        variable=echo "$variable"
#+                      invalid variable assignment

variable=\\
23skidoo
echo "$variable"        #  23skidoo
                        #  This works, since the second line
                        #+ is a valid variable assignment.

variable=\\ 
#        \\^    escape followed by space
echo "$variable"        # space

variable=\\\\
echo "$variable"        # \\

variable=\\\\\\
echo "$variable"
# Will not work - gives an error message:
# test.sh: \\: command not found
#
#  First escape escapes second one, but the third one is left "naked",
#+ with same result as first instance, above.

variable=\\\\\\\\
echo "$variable"        # \\\\
                        # Second and fourth escapes escaped.
                        # This is o.k.

Escaping a space can prevent word splitting in a command's argument list.

file\_list="/bin/cat /bin/gzip /bin/more /usr/bin/less /usr/bin/emacs-20.7"
# List of files as argument(s) to a command.

# Add two files to the list, and list all.
ls -l /usr/X11R6/bin/xsetroot /sbin/dump $file\_list

echo "-------------------------------------------------------------------------"

# What happens if we escape a couple of spaces?
ls -l /usr/X11R6/bin/xsetroot\\ /sbin/dump\\ $file\_list
# Error: the first three files concatenated into a single argument to 'ls -l'
#        because the two escaped spaces prevent argument (word) splitting.

The escape also provides a means of writing a multi-line command. Normally, each separate line constitutes a different command, but an escape at the end of a line _escapes the newline character_, and the command sequence continues on to the next line.

(cd /source/directory && tar cf - . ) | \\
(cd /dest/directory && tar xpvf -)
# Repeating Alan Cox's directory tree copy command,
# but split into two lines for increased legibility.

# As an alternative:
tar cf - -C /source/directory . |
tar xpvf - -C /dest/directory
# See note below.
# (Thanks, StÃ©phane Chazelas.)

If a script line ends with a |, a pipe character, then a \\, an escape, is not strictly necessary. It is, however, good programming practice to always escape the end of a line of code that continues to the following line.

echo "foo
bar" 
#foo
#bar

echo

echo 'foo
bar'    # No difference yet.
#foo
#bar

echo

echo foo\\
bar     # Newline escaped.
#foobar

echo

echo "foo\\
bar"     # Same here, as \\ still interpreted as escape within weak quotes.
#foobar

echo

echo 'foo\\
bar'     # Escape character \\ taken literally because of strong quoting.
#foo\\
#bar

Chapter 6. Exit and Exit Status
===============================

Â 

_

_... there are dark corners in the Bourne shell, and people use all of them._

_\--Chet Ramey_

_

The **exit** command terminates a script, just as in a **C** program. It can also return a value, which is available to the script's parent process.

Every command returns an _exit status_ (sometimes referred to as a _return status_ or _exit code_). A successful command returns a 0, while an unsuccessful one returns a non-zero value that usually can be interpreted as an _error code_. Well-behaved UNIX commands, programs, and utilities return a 0 exit code upon successful completion, though there are some exceptions.

Likewise, [functions](#FUNCTIONREF) within a script and the script itself return an exit status. The last command executed in the function or script determines the exit status. Within a script, an **exit _nnn_** command may be used to deliver an _nnn_ exit status to the shell (_nnn_ must be an integer in the 0 - 255 range).

![Note](../images/note.gif)

When a script ends with an **exit** that has no parameter, the exit status of the script is the exit status of the last command executed in the script (previous to the **exit**).

#!/bin/bash

COMMAND\_1

. . .

COMMAND\_LAST

# Will exit with status of last command.

exit

The equivalent of a bare **exit** is **exit $?** or even just omitting the **exit**.

#!/bin/bash

COMMAND\_1

. . .

COMMAND\_LAST

# Will exit with status of last command.

exit $?

#!/bin/bash

COMMAND1

. . . 

COMMAND\_LAST

# Will exit with status of last command.

$? reads the exit status of the last command executed. After a function returns, $? gives the exit status of the last command executed in the function. This is Bash's way of giving functions a "return value." [\[32\]](#FTN.AEN2981)

Following the execution of a [pipe](#PIPEREF), a $? gives the exit status of the last command executed.

After a script terminates, a $? from the command-line gives the exit status of the script, that is, the last command executed in the script, which is, by convention, **0** on success or an integer in the range 1 - 255 on error.

**Example 6-1. exit / exit status**

#!/bin/bash

echo hello
echo $?    # Exit status 0 returned because command executed successfully.

lskdf      # Unrecognized command.
echo $?    # Non-zero exit status returned -- command failed to execute.

echo

exit 113   # Will return 113 to shell.
           # To verify this, type "echo $?" after script terminates.

#  By convention, an 'exit 0' indicates success,
#+ while a non-zero exit value means an error or anomalous condition.
#  See the "Exit Codes With Special Meanings" appendix.

[$?](#XSTATVARREF) is especially useful for testing the result of a command in a script (see [Example 16-35](#FILECOMP) and [Example 16-20](#LOOKUP)).

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The [!](#NOTREF), the _logical not_ qualifier, reverses the outcome of a test or command, and this affects its [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF).

**Example 6-2. Negating a condition using !**

true    # The "true" builtin.
echo "exit status of \\"true\\" = $?"     # 0

! true
echo "exit status of \\"! true\\" = $?"   # 1
# Note that the "!" needs a space between it and the command.
#    !true   leads to a "command not found" error
#
# The '!' operator prefixing a command invokes the Bash history mechanism.

true
!true
# No error this time, but no negation either.
# It just repeats the previous command (true).


# =========================================================== #
# Preceding a \_pipe\_ with ! inverts the exit status returned.
ls | bogus\_command     # bash: bogus\_command: command not found
echo $?                # 127

! ls | bogus\_command   # bash: bogus\_command: command not found
echo $?                # 0
# Note that the ! does not change the execution of the pipe.
# Only the exit status changes.
# =========================================================== #

# Thanks, StÃ©phane Chazelas and Kristopher Newsome.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Certain exit status codes have [reserved meanings](#EXITCODESREF) and should not be user-specified in a script.

* * *

Chapter 7. Tests
================

Every reasonably complete programming language can test for a condition, then act according to the result of the test. Bash has the [test](#TTESTREF) command, various [bracket](#DBLBRACKETS) and [parenthesis](#DBLPARENSTST) operators, and the **if/then** construct.

* * *

7.1. Test Constructs
====================

*   An **if/then** construct tests whether the [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) of a list of commands is 0 (since 0 means "success" by UNIX convention), and if so, executes one or more commands.
    
*   There exists a dedicated command called **\[** ([left bracket](#LEFTBRACKET) special character). It is a synonym for **test**, and a [builtin](#BUILTINREF) for efficiency reasons. This command considers its arguments as comparison expressions or file tests and returns an exit status corresponding to the result of the comparison (0 for true, 1 for false).
    
*   With version 2.02, Bash introduced the [\[\[ ... \]\]](#DBLBRACKETS) _extended test command_, which performs comparisons in a manner more familiar to programmers from other languages. Note that **\[\[** is a [keyword](#KEYWORDREF), not a command.
    
    Bash sees **\[\[ $a -lt $b \]\]** as a single element, which returns an exit status.
    
*   The [(( ... ))](#DBLPARENS) and [let ...](#LETREF) constructs return an [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF), _according to whether the arithmetic expressions they evaluate expand to a non-zero value_. These [arithmetic-expansion](#ARITHEXPREF) constructs may therefore be used to perform [arithmetic comparisons](#ICOMPARISON1).
    
    (( 0 && 1 ))                 # Logical AND
    echo $?     # 1     \*\*\*
    # And so ...
    let "num = (( 0 && 1 ))"
    echo $num   # 0
    # But ...
    let "num = (( 0 && 1 ))"
    echo $?     # 1     \*\*\*
    
    
    (( 200 || 11 ))              # Logical OR
    echo $?     # 0     \*\*\*
    # ...
    let "num = (( 200 || 11 ))"
    echo $num   # 1
    let "num = (( 200 || 11 ))"
    echo $?     # 0     \*\*\*
    
    
    (( 200 | 11 ))               # Bitwise OR
    echo $?                      # 0     \*\*\*
    # ...
    let "num = (( 200 | 11 ))"
    echo $num                    # 203
    let "num = (( 200 | 11 ))"
    echo $?                      # 0     \*\*\*
    
    # The "let" construct returns the same exit status
    #+ as the double-parentheses arithmetic expansion.
    
    ![Caution](../images/caution.gif)
    
    Again, note that the _exit status_ of an arithmetic expression is _not_ an error value.
    
    var=-2 && (( var+=2 ))
    echo $?                   # 1
    
    var=-2 && (( var+=2 )) && echo $var
                              # Will not echo $var!
    
*   An **if** can test any command, not just conditions enclosed within brackets.
    
    if cmp a b &> /dev/null  # Suppress output.
    then echo "Files a and b are identical."
    else echo "Files a and b differ."
    fi
    
    # The very useful "if-grep" construct:
    # ----------------------------------- 
    if grep -q Bash file
      then echo "File contains at least one occurrence of Bash."
    fi
    
    word=Linux
    letter\_sequence=inu
    if echo "$word" | grep -q "$letter\_sequence"
    # The "-q" option to grep suppresses output.
    then
      echo "$letter\_sequence found in $word"
    else
      echo "$letter\_sequence not found in $word"
    fi
    
    
    if COMMAND\_WHOSE\_EXIT\_STATUS\_IS\_0\_UNLESS\_ERROR\_OCCURRED
      then echo "Command succeeded."
      else echo "Command failed."

**Example 7-1. What is truth?**

#!/bin/bash

#  Tip:
#  If you're unsure how a certain condition might evaluate,
#+ test it in an if-test.

echo

echo "Testing \\"0\\""
if \[ 0 \]      # zero
then
  echo "0 is true."
else          # Or else ...
  echo "0 is false."
fi            # 0 is true.

echo

echo "Testing \\"1\\""
if \[ 1 \]      # one
then
  echo "1 is true."
else
  echo "1 is false."
fi            # 1 is true.

echo

if \[ -1 \]     # minus one
then
  echo "-1 is true."
else
  echo "-1 is false."
fi            # -1 is true.

echo

echo "Testing \\"NULL\\""
if \[ \]        # NULL (empty condition)
then
  echo "NULL is true."
else
  echo "NULL is false."
fi            # NULL is false.

echo

echo "Testing \\"xyz\\""
if \[ xyz \]    # string
then
  echo "Random string is true."
else
  echo "Random string is false."
fi            # Random string is true.

echo

echo "Testing \\"\\$xyz\\""
if \[ $xyz \]   # Tests if $xyz is null, but...
              # it's only an uninitialized variable.
then
  echo "Uninitialized variable is true."
else
  echo "Uninitialized variable is false."
fi            # Uninitialized variable is false.

echo

echo "Testing \\"-n \\$xyz\\""
if \[ -n "$xyz" \]            # More pedantically correct.
then
  echo "Uninitialized variable is true."
else
  echo "Uninitialized variable is false."
fi            # Uninitialized variable is false.

echo


xyz=          # Initialized, but set to null value.

echo "Testing \\"-n \\$xyz\\""
if \[ -n "$xyz" \]
then
  echo "Null variable is true."
else
  echo "Null variable is false."
fi            # Null variable is false.


echo


# When is "false" true?

echo "Testing \\"false\\""
if \[ "false" \]              #  It seems that "false" is just a string ...
then
  echo "\\"false\\" is true." #+ and it tests true.
else
  echo "\\"false\\" is false."
fi            # "false" is true.

echo

echo "Testing \\"\\$false\\""  # Again, uninitialized variable.

  echo "\\"\\$false\\" is true."
else
  echo "\\"\\$false\\" is false."
fi            # "$false" is false.
              # Now, we get the expected result.

#  What would happen if we tested the uninitialized variable "$true"?

echo

exit 0

**Exercise.** Explain the behavior of [Example 7-1](#EX10), above.

if \[ condition-true \]
then
   command 1
   command 2
   ...
else  # Or else ...
      # Adds default code block executing if original condition tests false.
   command 3
   command 4
   ...
fi

![Note](../images/note.gif)

When _if_ and _then_ are on same line in a condition test, a semicolon must terminate the _if_ statement. Both _if_ and _then_ are [keywords](#KEYWORDREF). Keywords (or commands) begin statements, and before a new statement on the same line begins, the old one must terminate.

if \[ -x "$filename" \]; then

**Else if and elif**

elif

**elif** is a contraction for _else if_. The effect is to nest an inner if/then construct within an outer one.

if \[ condition1 \]
then
   command1
   command2
   command3
elif \[ condition2 \]
# Same as else if
then
   command4
   command5
else
   default-command
fi

The **if test condition-true** construct is the exact equivalent of **if \[ condition-true \]**. As it happens, the left bracket, **\[** , is a _token_ [\[33\]](#FTN.AEN3140) which invokes the **test** command. The closing right bracket, **\]** , in an if/test should not therefore be strictly necessary, however newer versions of Bash require it.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The **test** command is a Bash [builtin](#BUILTINREF) which tests file types and compares strings. Therefore, in a Bash script, **test** does _not_ call the external /usr/bin/test binary, which is part of the _sh-utils_ package. Likewise, **\[** does not call /usr/bin/\[, which is linked to /usr/bin/test.

bash$ **type test**
test is a shell builtin
bash$ **type '\['**
\[ is a shell builtin
bash$ **type '\[\['**
\[\[ is a shell keyword
bash$ **type '\]\]'**
\]\] is a shell keyword
bash$ **type '\]'**
bash: type: \]: not found
	      

If, for some reason, you wish to use /usr/bin/test in a Bash script, then specify it by full pathname.

**Example 7-2. Equivalence of _test_, /usr/bin/test, \[ \], and /usr/bin/\[**

#!/bin/bash

echo

if test -z "$1"
then
  echo "No command-line arguments."
else
  echo "First command-line argument is $1."
fi

echo

if /usr/bin/test -z "$1"      # Equivalent to "test" builtin.
#  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^              # Specifying full pathname.
then
  echo "No command-line arguments."
else
  echo "First command-line argument is $1."
fi

echo

if \[ -z "$1" \]                # Functionally identical to above code blocks.
#   if \[ -z "$1"                should work, but...
#+  Bash responds to a missing close-bracket with an error message.
then
  echo "No command-line arguments."
else
  echo "First command-line argument is $1."
fi

echo


if /usr/bin/\[ -z "$1" \]       # Again, functionally identical to above.
# if /usr/bin/\[ -z "$1"       # Works, but gives an error message.
#                             # Note:
#                               This has been fixed in Bash, version 3.x.
then
  echo "No command-line arguments."
else
  echo "First command-line argument is $1."
fi

echo

exit 0

The \[\[ \]\] construct is the more versatile Bash version of \[ \]. This is the _extended test command_, adopted from _ksh88_.

\* \* \*

No filename expansion or word splitting takes place between \[\[ and \]\], but there is parameter expansion and command substitution.

file=/etc/passwd

if \[\[ -e $file \]\]
then
  echo "Password file exists."
fi

Using the **\[\[ ... \]\]** test construct, rather than **\[ ... \]** can prevent many logic errors in scripts. For example, the &&, ||, <, and \> operators work within a \[\[ \]\] test, despite giving an error within a \[ \] construct.

_Arithmetic evaluation_ of octal / hexadecimal constants takes place automatically within a \[\[ ... \]\] construct.

\# \[\[ Octal and hexadecimal evaluation \]\]
# Thank you, Moritz Gronbach, for pointing this out.


decimal=15
octal=017   # = 15 (decimal)
hex=0x0f    # = 15 (decimal)

if \[ "$decimal" -eq "$octal" \]
then
  echo "$decimal equals $octal"
else
  echo "$decimal is not equal to $octal"       # 15 is not equal to 017
fi      # Doesn't evaluate within \[ single brackets \]!


if \[\[ "$decimal" -eq "$octal" \]\]
then
  echo "$decimal equals $octal"                # 15 equals 017
else
  echo "$decimal is not equal to $octal"
fi      # Evaluates within \[\[ double brackets \]\]!

if \[\[ "$decimal" -eq "$hex" \]\]
then
  echo "$decimal equals $hex"                  # 15 equals 0x0f
else
  echo "$decimal is not equal to $hex"
fi      # \[\[ $hexadecimal \]\] also evaluates!

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Following an **if**, neither the **test** command nor the test brackets ( \[ \] or \[\[ \]\] ) are strictly necessary.

dir=/home/bozo

if cd "$dir" 2>/dev/null; then   # "2>/dev/null" hides error message.
  echo "Now in $dir."
else
  echo "Can't change to $dir."
fi

The "if COMMAND" construct returns the exit status of COMMAND.

Similarly, a condition within test brackets may stand alone without an **if**, when used in combination with a [list construct](#LISTCONSREF).

var1=20
var2=22
\[ "$var1" -ne "$var2" \] && echo "$var1 is not equal to $var2"

home=/home/bozo
\[ -d "$home" \] || echo "$home directory does not exist."

The [(( )) construct](#DBLPARENS) expands and evaluates an arithmetic expression. If the expression evaluates as zero, it returns an [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) of 1, or "false". A non-zero expression returns an exit status of 0, or "true". This is in marked contrast to using the **test** and \[ \] constructs previously discussed.

**Example 7-3. Arithmetic Tests using (( ))**

#!/bin/bash
# arith-tests.sh
# Arithmetic tests.

# The (( ... )) construct evaluates and tests numerical expressions.
# Exit status opposite from \[ ... \] construct!

(( 0 ))
echo "Exit status of \\"(( 0 ))\\" is $?."         # 1

(( 1 ))
echo "Exit status of \\"(( 1 ))\\" is $?."         # 0

(( 5 > 4 ))                                      # true
echo "Exit status of \\"(( 5 > 4 ))\\" is $?."     # 0

(( 5 > 9 ))                                      # false
echo "Exit status of \\"(( 5 > 9 ))\\" is $?."     # 1

(( 5 == 5 ))                                     # true
echo "Exit status of \\"(( 5 == 5 ))\\" is $?."    # 0
# (( 5 = 5 ))  gives an error message.

(( 5 - 5 ))                                      # 0
echo "Exit status of \\"(( 5 - 5 ))\\" is $?."     # 1

(( 5 / 4 ))                                      # Division o.k.
echo "Exit status of \\"(( 5 / 4 ))\\" is $?."     # 0

(( 1 / 2 ))                                      # Division result < 1.
echo "Exit status of \\"(( 1 / 2 ))\\" is $?."     # Rounded off to 0.
                                                 # 1

(( 1 / 0 )) 2>/dev/null                          # Illegal division by 0.
#           ^^^^^^^^^^^
echo "Exit status of \\"(( 1 / 0 ))\\" is $?."     # 1

# What effect does the "2>/dev/null" have?
# What would happen if it were removed?
# Try removing it, then rerunning the script.

# ======================================= #

# (( ... )) also useful in an if-then test.

var1=5
var2=4

if (( var1 > var2 ))
then #^      ^      Note: Not $var1, $var2. Why?
  echo "$var1 is greater than $var2"
fi     # 5 is greater than 4

\-h

file is a [symbolic link](#SYMLINKREF)

\-L

file is a symbolic link

\-S

file is a [socket](#SOCKETREF)

\-t

file ([descriptor](#FDREF)) is associated with a terminal device

This test option [may be used to check](#II2TEST) whether the stdin **\[ -t 0 \]** or stdout **\[ -t 1 \]** in a given script is a terminal.

\-r

file has read permission (_for the user running the test_)

\-w

file has write permission (for the user running the test)

\-x

file has execute permission (for the user running the test)

\-g

set-group-id (sgid) flag set on file or directory

If a directory has the _sgid_ flag set, then a file created within that directory belongs to the group that owns the directory, not necessarily to the group of the user who created the file. This may be useful for a directory shared by a workgroup.

\-u

set-user-id (suid) flag set on file

A binary owned by _root_ with _set-user-id_ flag set runs with _root_ privileges, even when an ordinary user invokes it. [\[35\]](#FTN.AEN3400) This is useful for executables (such as **pppd** and **cdrecord**) that need to access system hardware. Lacking the _suid_ flag, these binaries could not be invoked by a _non-root_ user.

	      \-rwsr-xr-t    1 root       178236 Oct  2  2000 /usr/sbin/pppd
	      

A file with the _suid_ flag set shows an _s_ in its permissions.

\-k

_sticky bit_ set

Commonly known as the _sticky bit,_ the _save-text-mode_ flag is a special type of file permission. If a file has this flag set, that file will be kept in cache memory, for quicker access. [\[36\]](#FTN.AEN3423) If set on a directory, it restricts write permission. Setting the sticky bit adds a _t_ to the permissions on the file or directory listing. This restricts altering or deleting specific files in that directory to the owner of those files.

	      drwxrwxrwt    7 root         1024 May 19 21:26 tmp/
	      

If a user does not own a directory that has the sticky bit set, but has write permission in that directory, she can only delete those files that she owns in it. This keeps users from inadvertently overwriting or deleting each other's files in a publicly accessible directory, such as /tmp. (The _owner_ of the directory or _root_ can, of course, delete or rename files there.)

\-O

you are owner of file

\-G

group-id of file same as yours

\-N

file modified since it was last read

f1 -nt f2

file _f1_ is newer than _f2_

f1 -ot f2

file _f1_ is older than _f2_

f1 -ef f2

files _f1_ and _f2_ are hard links to the same file

!

"not" -- reverses the sense of the tests above (returns true if condition absent).

7.3. Other Comparison Operators
===============================

A _binary_ comparison operator compares two variables or quantities. _Note that integer and string comparison use a different set of operators._

**integer comparison**

\-eq

is equal to

**if \[ "$a" -eq "$b" \]**

\-ne

is not equal to

**if \[ "$a" -ne "$b" \]**

\-gt

is greater than

**if \[ "$a" -gt "$b" \]**

\-ge

is greater than or equal to

**if \[ "$a" -ge "$b" \]**

\-lt

is less than

**if \[ "$a" -lt "$b" \]**

\-le

is less than or equal to

**if \[ "$a" -le "$b" \]**

<

is less than (within [double parentheses](#DBLPARENS))

**(("$a" < "$b"))**

<=

is less than or equal to (within double parentheses)

**(("$a" <= "$b"))**

\>

is greater than (within double parentheses)

**(("$a" > "$b"))**

\>=

is greater than or equal to (within double parentheses)

**(("$a" >= "$b"))**

**string comparison**

\=

is equal to

**if \[ "$a" = "$b" \]**

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Note the [whitespace](#WHITESPACEREF) framing the **\=**.

**if \[ "$a"="$b" \]** is _not_ equivalent to the above.

\==

is equal to

**if \[ "$a" == "$b" \]**

This is a synonym for \=.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The \== comparison operator behaves differently within a [double-brackets](#DBLBRACKETS) test than within single brackets.

\[\[ $a == z\* \]\]   # True if $a starts with an "z" (pattern matching).
\[\[ $a == "z\*" \]\] # True if $a is equal to z\* (literal matching).

\[ $a == z\* \]     # File globbing and word splitting take place.
\[ "$a" == "z\*" \] # True if $a is equal to z\* (literal matching).

# Thanks, StÃ©phane Chazelas

!=

is not equal to

**if \[ "$a" != "$b" \]**

This operator uses pattern matching within a [\[\[ ... \]\]](#DBLBRACKETS) construct.

<

is less than, in [ASCII](#ASCIIDEF) alphabetical order

**if \[\[ "$a" < "$b" \]\]**

**if \[ "$a" \\< "$b" \]**

Note that the "<" needs to be [escaped](#ESCP) within a **\[ \]** construct.

\>

is greater than, in ASCII alphabetical order

**if \[\[ "$a" > "$b" \]\]**

**if \[ "$a" \\> "$b" \]**

Note that the ">" needs to be escaped within a **\[ \]** construct.

See [Example 27-11](#BUBBLE) for an application of this comparison operator.

\-z

string is _null_, that is, has zero length

 String=''   # Zero-length ("null") string variable.

if \[ -z "$String" \]
then
  echo "\\$String is null."
else
  echo "\\$String is NOT null."
fi     # $String is null.

\-n

string is not _null._

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

The **\-n** test requires that the string be quoted within the test brackets. Using an unquoted string with _! -z_, or even just the unquoted string alone within test brackets (see [Example 7-6](#STRTEST)) normally works, however, this is an unsafe practice. _Always_ quote a tested string. [\[37\]](#FTN.AEN3669)

**Example 7-5. Arithmetic and string comparisons**

#!/bin/bash

a=4
b=5

#  Here "a" and "b" can be treated either as integers or strings.
#  There is some blurring between the arithmetic and string comparisons,
#+ since Bash variables are not strongly typed.

#  Bash permits integer operations and comparisons on variables
#+ whose value consists of all-integer characters.
#  Caution advised, however.

echo

if \[ "$a" -ne "$b" \]
then
  echo "$a is not equal to $b"
  echo "(arithmetic comparison)"
fi

echo

if \[ "$a" != "$b" \]
then
  echo "$a is not equal to $b."
  echo "(string comparison)"
  #     "4"  != "5"
  # ASCII 52 != ASCII 53
fi

# In this particular instance, both "-ne" and "!=" work.

echo

exit 0

**Example 7-6. Testing whether a string is _null_**

#!/bin/bash
#  str-test.sh: Testing null strings and unquoted strings,
#+ but not strings and sealing wax, not to mention cabbages and kings . . .

# Using   if \[ ... \]

# If a string has not been initialized, it has no defined value.
# This state is called "null" (not the same as zero!).

if \[ -n $string1 \]    # string1 has not been declared or initialized.
then
  echo "String \\"string1\\" is not null."
else  
  echo "String \\"string1\\" is null."
fi                    # Wrong result.
# Shows $string1 as not null, although it was not initialized.

echo

# Let's try it again.

if \[ -n "$string1" \]  # This time, $string1 is quoted.
then
  echo "String \\"string1\\" is not null."
else  
  echo "String \\"string1\\" is null."
fi                    # Quote strings within test brackets!

echo

if \[ $string1 \]       # This time, $string1 stands naked.
then
  echo "String \\"string1\\" is not null."
else  
  echo "String \\"string1\\" is null."
fi                    # This works fine.
# The \[ ... \] test operator alone detects whether the string is null.
# However it is good practice to quote it (if \[ "$string1" \]).
#
# As Stephane Chazelas points out,
#    if \[ $string1 \]    has one argument, "\]"
#    if \[ "$string1" \]  has two arguments, the empty "$string1" and "\]" 


echo


string1=initialized

if \[ $string1 \]       # Again, $string1 stands unquoted.
then
  echo "String \\"string1\\" is not null."
else  
  echo "String \\"string1\\" is null."
fi                    # Again, gives correct result.
# Still, it is better to quote it ("$string1"), because . . .


string1="a = b"

if \[ $string1 \]       # Again, $string1 stands unquoted.
then
  echo "String \\"string1\\" is not null."
else  
  echo "String \\"string1\\" is null."
fi                    # Not quoting "$string1" now gives wrong result!

exit 0   # Thank you, also, Florian Wisser, for the "heads-up".

**Example 7-7. _zmore_**

#!/bin/bash
# zmore

# View gzipped files with 'more' filter.

E\_NOARGS=85
E\_NOTFOUND=86
E\_NOTGZIP=87

if \[ $# -eq 0 \] # same effect as:  if \[ -z "$1" \]
# $1 can exist, but be empty:  zmore "" arg2 arg3
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` filename" >&2
  # Error message to stderr.
  exit $E\_NOARGS
  # Returns 85 as exit status of script (error code).
fi  

filename=$1

if \[ ! -f "$filename" \]   # Quoting $filename allows for possible spaces.
then
  echo "File $filename not found!" >&2   # Error message to stderr.
  exit $E\_NOTFOUND
fi  

if \[ ${filename##\*.} != "gz" \]
# Using bracket in variable substitution.
then
  echo "File $1 is not a gzipped file!"
  exit $E\_NOTGZIP
fi  

zcat $1 | more

# Uses the 'more' filter.
# May substitute 'less' if desired.

exit $?   # Script returns exit status of pipe.
#  Actually "exit $?" is unnecessary, as the script will, in any case,
#+ return the exit status of the last command executed.

**compound comparison**

\-a

logical and

_exp1 -a exp2_ returns true if _both_ exp1 and exp2 are true.

\-o

logical or

_exp1 -o exp2_ returns true if either exp1 _or_ exp2 is true.

These are similar to the Bash comparison operators **&&** and **||**, used within [double brackets](#DBLBRACKETS).

\[\[ condition1 && condition2 \]\]

The **\-o** and **\-a** operators work with the [test](#TTESTREF) command or occur within single test brackets.

if \[ "$expr1" -a "$expr2" \]
then
  echo "Both expr1 and expr2 are true."
else
  echo "Either expr1 or expr2 is false."
fi

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

But, as _rihad_ points out:

\[ 1 -eq 1 \] && \[ -n "\`echo true 1>&2\`" \]   # true
\[ 1 -eq 2 \] && \[ -n "\`echo true 1>&2\`" \]   # (no output)
# ^^^^^^^ False condition. So far, everything as expected.

# However ...
\[ 1 -eq 2 -a -n "\`echo true 1>&2\`" \]       # true
# ^^^^^^^ False condition. So, why "true" output?

# Is it because both condition clauses within brackets evaluate?
\[\[ 1 -eq 2 && -n "\`echo true 1>&2\`" \]\]     # (no output)
# No, that's not it.

# Apparently && and || "short-circuit" while -a and -o do not.

Refer to [Example 8-3](#ANDOR), [Example 27-17](#TWODIM), and [Example A-29](#WHX) to see compound comparison operators in action.

* * *

7.4. Nested _if/then_ Condition Tests
=====================================

Condition tests using the _if/then_ construct may be nested. The net result is equivalent to using the [_&&_](#LOGOPS1) compound comparison operator.

a=3

if \[ "$a" -gt 0 \]
then
  if \[ "$a" -lt 5 \]
  then
    echo "The value of \\"a\\" lies somewhere between 0 and 5."
  fi
fi

# Same result as:

if \[ "$a" -gt 0 \] && \[ "$a" -lt 5 \]
then
  echo "The value of \\"a\\" lies somewhere between 0 and 5."
fi

[Example 37-4](#CARDS) and [Example 17-11](#BACKLIGHT) demonstrate nested _if/then_ condition tests.

* * *

7.5. Testing Your Knowledge of Tests
====================================

The systemwide xinitrc file can be used to launch the X server. This file contains quite a number of _if/then_ tests. The following is excerpted from an "ancient" version of xinitrc (_Red Hat 7.1_, or thereabouts).

if \[ -f $HOME/.Xclients \]; then
  exec $HOME/.Xclients
elif \[ -f /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients \]; then
  exec /etc/X11/xinit/Xclients
else
     # failsafe settings.  Although we should never get here
     # (we provide fallbacks in Xclients as well) it can't hurt.
     xclock -geometry 100x100-5+5 &
     xterm -geometry 80x50-50+150 &
     if \[ -f /usr/bin/netscape -a -f /usr/share/doc/HTML/index.html \]; then
             netscape /usr/share/doc/HTML/index.html &
     fi
fi

Explain the _test_ constructs in the above snippet, then examine an updated version of the file, /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc, and analyze the _if/then_ test constructs there. You may need to refer ahead to the discussions of [grep](#GREPREF), [sed](#SEDREF), and [regular expressions](#REGEXREF).

* * *

Chapter 8. Operations and Related Topics
========================================

8.1. Operators
==============

**assignment**

_variable assignment_

Initializing or changing the value of a variable

\=

All-purpose assignment operator, which works for both arithmetic and string assignments.

var=27
category=minerals  # No spaces allowed after the "=".

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Do not confuse the "=" assignment operator with the [\= test operator](#EQUALSIGNREF).

\#   =  as a test operator

if \[ "$string1" = "$string2" \]
then
   command
fi

#  if \[ "X$string1" = "X$string2" \] is safer,
#+ to prevent an error message should one of the variables be empty.
#  (The prepended "X" characters cancel out.)

**arithmetic operators**

+

plus

\-

minus

\*

multiplication

/

division

\*\*

exponentiation

\# Bash, version 2.02, introduced the "\*\*" exponentiation operator.

let "z=5\*\*3"    # 5 \* 5 \* 5
echo "z = $z"   # z = 125

%

modulo, or mod (returns the _remainder_ of an integer division operation)

bash$ **expr 5 % 3**
2
	      

_5/3 = 1, with remainder 2_

This operator finds use in, among other things, generating numbers within a specific range (see [Example 9-11](#EX21) and [Example 9-15](#RANDOMTEST)) and formatting program output (see [Example 27-16](#QFUNCTION) and [Example A-6](#COLLATZ)). It can even be used to generate prime numbers, (see [Example A-15](#PRIMES)). Modulo turns up surprisingly often in numerical recipes.

**Example 8-1. Greatest common divisor**

#!/bin/bash
# gcd.sh: greatest common divisor
#         Uses Euclid's algorithm

#  The "greatest common divisor" (gcd) of two integers
#+ is the largest integer that will divide both, leaving no remainder.

#  Euclid's algorithm uses successive division.
#    In each pass,
#+      dividend <---  divisor
#+      divisor  <---  remainder
#+   until remainder = 0.
#    The gcd = dividend, on the final pass.
#
#  For an excellent discussion of Euclid's algorithm, see

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Integer variables in older versions of Bash were signed _long_ (32-bit) integers, in the range of -2147483648 to 2147483647. An operation that took a variable outside these limits gave an erroneous result.

echo $BASH\_VERSION   # 1.14

a=2147483646
echo "a = $a"        # a = 2147483646
let "a+=1"           # Increment "a".
echo "a = $a"        # a = 2147483647
let "a+=1"           # increment "a" again, past the limit.
echo "a = $a"        # a = -2147483648
                     #      ERROR: out of range,
                     # +    and the leftmost bit, the sign bit,
                     # +    has been set, making the result negative.

As of version >= 2.05b, Bash supports 64-bit integers.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Bash does not understand floating point arithmetic. It treats numbers containing a decimal point as strings.

a=1.5

let "b = $a + 1.3"  # Error.
# t2.sh: let: b = 1.5 + 1.3: syntax error in expression
#                            (error token is ".5 + 1.3")

echo "b = $b"       # b=1

Use [bc](#BCREF) in scripts that that need floating point calculations or math library functions.

**bitwise operators.** The bitwise operators seldom make an appearance in shell scripts. Their chief use seems to be manipulating and testing values read from ports or [sockets](#SOCKETREF). "Bit flipping" is more relevant to compiled languages, such as C and C++, which provide direct access to system hardware. However, see _vladz's_ ingenious use of bitwise operators in his _base64.sh_ ([Example A-54](#BASE64)) script.

**bitwise operators**

<<

bitwise left shift (multiplies by 2 for each shift position)

<<=

_left-shift-equal_

**let "var <<= 2"** results in _var_ left-shifted 2 bits (multiplied by 4)

\>>

bitwise right shift (divides by 2 for each shift position)

\>>=

_right-shift-equal_ (inverse of <<=)

&

bitwise AND

&=

bitwise _AND-equal_

|

bitwise OR

|=

bitwise _OR-equal_

~

bitwise NOT

^

bitwise XOR

^=

bitwise _XOR-equal_

**logical (boolean) operators**

!

NOT

if \[ ! -f $FILENAME \]
then
  ...

&&

AND

if \[ $condition1 \] && \[ $condition2 \]
#  Same as:  if \[ $condition1 -a $condition2 \]
#  Returns true if both condition1 and condition2 hold true...

if \[\[ $condition1 && $condition2 \]\]    # Also works.
#  Note that && operator not permitted _inside brackets_
#+ of \[ ... \] construct.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

&& may also be used, depending on context, in an [and list](#LISTCONSREF) to concatenate commands.

||

OR

if \[ $condition1 \] || \[ $condition2 \]
# Same as:  if \[ $condition1 -o $condition2 \]
# Returns true if either condition1 or condition2 holds true...

if \[\[ $condition1 || $condition2 \]\]    # Also works.
#  Note that || operator not permitted _inside brackets_
#+ of a \[ ... \] construct.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Bash tests the [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) of each statement linked with a logical operator.

**Example 8-3. Compound Condition Tests Using && and ||**

#!/bin/bash

a=24
b=47

if \[ "$a" -eq 24 \] && \[ "$b" -eq 47 \]
then
  echo "Test #1 succeeds."
else
  echo "Test #1 fails."
fi

# ERROR:   if \[ "$a" -eq 24 && "$b" -eq 47 \]

exit 0

The && and || operators also find use in an arithmetic context.

bash$ **echo $(( 1 && 2 )) $((3 && 0)) $((4 || 0)) $((0 || 0))**
1 0 1 0
	      

**miscellaneous operators**

,

Comma operator

The **comma operator** chains together two or more arithmetic operations. All the operations are evaluated (with possible _side effects_. [\[39\]](#FTN.AEN4242)

let "t1 = ((5 + 3, 7 - 1, 15 - 4))"
echo "t1 = $t1"           ^^^^^^  # t1 = 11
# Here t1 is set to the result of the last operation. Why?

let "t2 = ((a = 9, 15 / 3))"      # Set "a" and calculate "t2".
echo "t2 = $t2    a = $a"         # t2 = 5    a = 9

The comma operator finds use mainly in [for loops](#FORLOOPREF1). See [Example 11-13](#FORLOOPC).

8.2. Numerical Constants
========================

A shell script interprets a number as decimal (base 10), unless that number has a special prefix or notation. A number preceded by a _0_ is _octal_ (base 8). A number preceded by _0x_ is _hexadecimal_ (base 16). A number with an embedded _#_ evaluates as _BASE#NUMBER_ (with range and notational restrictions).

**Example 8-4. Representation of numerical constants**

#!/bin/bash
# numbers.sh: Representation of numbers in different bases.

# Decimal: the default
let "dec = 32"
echo "decimal number = $dec"             # 32
# Nothing out of the ordinary here.


# Octal: numbers preceded by '0' (zero)
let "oct = 032"
echo "octal number = $oct"               # 26
# Expresses result in decimal.
# --------- ------ -- -------


# Hexadecimal: numbers preceded by '0x' or '0X'
let "hex = 0x32"
echo "hexadecimal number = $hex"         # 50

echo $((0x9abc))                         # 39612
#     ^^      ^^   double-parentheses arithmetic expansion/evaluation
# Expresses result in decimal.



# Other bases: BASE#NUMBER
# BASE between 2 and 64.
# NUMBER must use symbols within the BASE range, see below.


let "bin = 2#111100111001101"
echo "binary number = $bin"              # 31181

let "b32 = 32#77"
echo "base-32 number = $b32"             # 231

let "b64 = 64#@\_"
echo "base-64 number = $b64"             # 4031
# This notation only works for a limited range (2 - 64) of ASCII characters.
# 10 digits + 26 lowercase characters + 26 uppercase characters + @ + \_


echo

echo $((36#zz)) $((2#10101010)) $((16#AF16)) $((53#1aA))
                                         # 1295 170 44822 3375


#  Important note:
#  --------------
#  Using a digit out of range of the specified base notation
#+ gives an error message.

let "bad\_oct = 081"
# (Partial) error message output:
#  bad\_oct = 081: value too great for base (error token is "081")
#              Octal numbers use only digits in the range 0 - 7.

exit $?   # Exit value = 1 (error)

# Thanks, Rich Bartell and Stephane Chazelas, for clarification.

8.3. The Double-Parentheses Construct
=====================================

Similar to the [let](#LETREF) command, the **(( ... ))** construct permits arithmetic expansion and evaluation. In its simplest form, **a=$(( 5 + 3 ))** would set **a** to **5 + 3**, or **8**. However, this double-parentheses construct is also a mechanism for allowing C-style manipulation of variables in Bash, for example, (( var++ )).

**Example 8-5. C-style manipulation of variables**

#!/bin/bash
# c-vars.sh
# Manipulating a variable, C-style, using the (( ... )) construct.


echo

(( a = 23 ))  #  Setting a value, C-style,
              #+ with spaces on both sides of the "=".
echo "a (initial value) = $a"   # 23

(( a++ ))     #  Post-increment 'a', C-style.
echo "a (after a++) = $a"       # 24

(( a-- ))     #  Post-decrement 'a', C-style.
echo "a (after a--) = $a"       # 23


(( ++a ))     #  Pre-increment 'a', C-style.
echo "a (after ++a) = $a"       # 24

(( --a ))     #  Pre-decrement 'a', C-style.
echo "a (after --a) = $a"       # 23

echo

########################################################
#  Note that, as in C, pre- and post-decrement operators
#+ have different side-effects.

n=1; let --n && echo "True" || echo "False"  # False
n=1; let n-- && echo "True" || echo "False"  # True

#  Thanks, Jeroen Domburg.
########################################################

echo

(( t = a<45?7:11 ))   # C-style trinary operator.
#       ^  ^ ^
echo "If a < 45, then t = 7, else t = 11."  # a = 23
echo "t = $t "                              # t = 7

echo


# -----------------
# Easter Egg alert!
# -----------------
#  Chet Ramey seems to have snuck a bunch of undocumented C-style
#+ constructs into Bash (actually adapted from ksh, pretty much).
#  In the Bash docs, Ramey calls (( ... )) shell arithmetic,
#+ but it goes far beyond that.
#  Sorry, Chet, the secret is out.

# See also "for" and "while" loops using the (( ... )) construct.

# These work only with version 2.04 or later of Bash.

8.4. Operator Precedence
========================

In a script, operations execute in order of _precedence_: the higher precedence operations execute _before_ the lower precedence ones. [\[40\]](#FTN.AEN4290)

**LOWEST PRECEDENCE**

In practice, all you really need to remember is the following:

*   The "My Dear Aunt Sally" mantra (_multiply, divide, add, subtract_) for the familiar [arithmetic operations](#AROPS1).
    
*   The _compound_ logical operators, **&&**, **||**, **\-a**, and **\-o** have low precedence.
    
*   The order of evaluation of equal-precedence operators is usually _left-to-right_.
    

Now, let's utilize our knowledge of operator precedence to analyze a couple of lines from the /etc/init.d/functions file, as found in the _Fedora Core_ Linux distro.

while \[ -n "$remaining" -a "$retry" -gt 0 \]; do

# This looks rather daunting at first glance.


# Separate the conditions:
while \[ -n "$remaining" -a "$retry" -gt 0 \]; do
#       --condition 1-- ^^ --condition 2-

#  If variable "$remaining" is not zero length
#+      AND (-a)
#+ variable "$retry" is greater-than zero
#+ then
#+ the \[ expresion-within-condition-brackets \] returns success (0)
#+ and the while-loop executes an iteration.
#  ==============================================================
#  Evaluate "condition 1" and "condition 2" \*\*\*before\*\*\*
#+ ANDing them. Why? Because the AND (-a) has a lower precedence
#+ than the -n and -gt operators,
#+ and therefore gets evaluated \*last\*.

#################################################################

if \[ -f /etc/sysconfig/i18n -a -z "${NOLOCALE:-}" \] ; then


# Again, separate the conditions:
if \[ -f /etc/sysconfig/i18n -a -z "${NOLOCALE:-}" \] ; then
#    --condition 1--------- ^^ --condition 2-----

#  If file "/etc/sysconfig/i18n" exists
#+      AND (-a)
#+ variable $NOLOCALE is zero length
#+ then
#+ the \[ test-expresion-within-condition-brackets \] returns success (0)
#+ and the commands following execute.
#
#  As before, the AND (-a) gets evaluated \*last\*
#+ because it has the lowest precedence of the operators within
#+ the test brackets.
#  ==============================================================
#  Note:
#  ${NOLOCALE:-} is a parameter expansion that seems redundant.
#  But, if $NOLOCALE has not been declared, it gets set to \*null\*,
#+ in effect declaring it.
#  This makes a difference in some contexts.

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

To avoid confusion or error in a complex sequence of test operators, break up the sequence into bracketed sections.

if \[ "$v1" -gt "$v2"  -o  "$v1" -lt "$v2"  -a  -e "$filename" \]
# Unclear what's going on here...

if \[\[ "$v1" -gt "$v2" \]\] || \[\[ "$v1" -lt "$v2" \]\] && \[\[ -e "$filename" \]\]
# Much better -- the condition tests are grouped in logical sections.

Chapter 9. Another Look at Variables
====================================

Used properly, variables can add power and flexibility to scripts. This requires learning their subtleties and nuances.

* * *

9.1. Internal Variables
=======================

_[Builtin](#BUILTINREF) variables:_

variables affecting bash script behavior

$BASH

The path to the _Bash_ binary itself

bash$ **echo $BASH**
/bin/bash

$BASH\_ENV

An [environmental variable](#ENVREF) pointing to a Bash startup file to be read when a script is invoked

$BASH\_SUBSHELL

A variable indicating the [subshell](#SUBSHELLSREF) level. This is a new addition to Bash, [version 3](#BASH3REF).

See [Example 21-1](#SUBSHELL) for usage.

$BASHPID

_Process ID_ of the current instance of Bash. This is not the same as the [$$](#PROCCID) variable, but it often gives the same result.

bash4$ **echo $$**
11015

bash4$ **echo $BASHPID**
11015

bash4$ **ps ax | grep bash4**
11015 pts/2    R      0:00 bash4
	      

But ...

#!/bin/bash4

echo "\\$\\$ outside of subshell = $$"                              # 9602
echo "\\$BASH\_SUBSHELL  outside of subshell = $BASH\_SUBSHELL"      # 0
echo "\\$BASHPID outside of subshell = $BASHPID"                   # 9602

echo

( echo "\\$\\$ inside of subshell = $$"                             # 9602
  echo "\\$BASH\_SUBSHELL inside of subshell = $BASH\_SUBSHELL"      # 1
  echo "\\$BASHPID inside of subshell = $BASHPID" )                # 9603
  # Note that $$ returns PID of parent process.

$BASH\_VERSINFO\[n\]

A 6-element [array](#ARRAYREF) containing version information about the installed release of Bash. This is similar to $BASH\_VERSION, below, but a bit more detailed.

\# Bash version info:

for n in 0 1 2 3 4 5
do
  echo "BASH\_VERSINFO\[$n\] = ${BASH\_VERSINFO\[$n\]}"
done  

# BASH\_VERSINFO\[0\] = 3                      # Major version no.
# BASH\_VERSINFO\[1\] = 00                     # Minor version no.
# BASH\_VERSINFO\[2\] = 14                     # Patch level.
# BASH\_VERSINFO\[3\] = 1                      # Build version.
# BASH\_VERSINFO\[4\] = release                # Release status.
# BASH\_VERSINFO\[5\] = i386-redhat-linux-gnu  # Architecture
                                            # (same as $MACHTYPE).

$BASH\_VERSION

The version of Bash installed on the system

bash$ **echo $BASH\_VERSION**
3.2.25(1)-release
	      

tcsh% **echo $BASH\_VERSION**
BASH\_VERSION: Undefined variable.
	      

Checking $BASH\_VERSION is a good method of determining which shell is running. [$SHELL](#SHELLVARREF) does not necessarily give the correct answer.

$CDPATH

A colon-separated list of search paths available to the [cd](#CDREF) command, similar in function to the [$PATH](#PATHREF) variable for binaries. The $CDPATH variable may be set in the local [~/.bashrc](#BASHRC) file.

bash$ **cd bash-doc**
bash: cd: bash-doc: No such file or directory

bash$ **CDPATH=/usr/share/doc**
bash$ **cd bash-doc**
/usr/share/doc/bash-doc

bash$ **echo $PWD**
/usr/share/doc/bash-doc
	      

$DIRSTACK

The top value in the directory stack [\[41\]](#FTN.AEN4671) (affected by [pushd](#PUSHDREF) and [popd](#POPDREF))

This builtin variable corresponds to the [dirs](#DIRSD) command, however **dirs** shows the entire contents of the directory stack.

$EDITOR

The default editor invoked by a script, usually **vi** or **emacs**.

$EUID

"effective" user ID number

Identification number of whatever identity the current user has assumed, perhaps by means of [su](#SUREF).

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

The $EUID is not necessarily the same as the [$UID](#UIDREF).

$FUNCNAME

Name of the current function

xyz23 ()
{
  echo "$FUNCNAME now executing."  # xyz23 now executing.
}

xyz23

echo "FUNCNAME = $FUNCNAME"        # FUNCNAME =
                                   # Null value outside a function.

See also [Example A-50](#USEGETOPT).

$GLOBIGNORE

A list of filename patterns to be excluded from matching in [globbing](#GLOBBINGREF).

$GROUPS

Groups current user belongs to

This is a listing (array) of the group id numbers for current user, as recorded in [/etc/passwd](#DATAFILESREF1) and /etc/group.

root# **echo $GROUPS**
0

root# **echo ${GROUPS\[1\]}**
1

root# **echo ${GROUPS\[5\]}**
6
	      

$HOME

Home directory of the user, usually /home/username (see [Example 10-7](#EX6))

$HOSTNAME

The [hostname](#HNAMEREF) command assigns the system host name at bootup in an init script. However, the gethostname() function sets the Bash internal variable $HOSTNAME. See also [Example 10-7](#EX6).

$HOSTTYPE

host type

Like [$MACHTYPE](#MACHTYPEREF), identifies the system hardware.

bash$ **echo $HOSTTYPE**
i686

$IFS

internal field separator

This variable determines how Bash recognizes [fields](#FIELDREF), or word boundaries, when it interprets character strings.

$IFS defaults to [whitespace](#WHITESPACEREF) (space, tab, and newline), but may be changed, for example, to parse a comma-separated data file. Note that [$\*](#APPREF) uses the first character held in $IFS. See [Example 5-1](#WEIRDVARS).

bash$ **echo "$IFS"**
(With $IFS set to default, a blank line displays.)
	      

bash$ **echo "$IFS" | cat -vte**
 ^I$
 $
(Show whitespace: here a single space, ^I \[horizontal tab\],
  and newline, and display "$" at end-of-line.)

bash$ **bash -c 'set w x y z; IFS=":-;"; echo "$\*"'**
w:x:y:z
(Read commands from string and assign any arguments to pos params.)
	      

Set $IFS to eliminate whitespace in [pathnames](#PATHNAMEREF).

IFS="$(printf '\\n\\t')"   # Per David Wheeler.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

$IFS does not handle whitespace the same as it does other characters.

**Example 9-1. $IFS and whitespace**

#!/bin/bash
# ifs.sh


var1="a+b+c"
var2="d-e-f"
var3="g,h,i"

IFS=+
# The plus sign will be interpreted as a separator.
echo $var1     # a b c
echo $var2     # d-e-f
echo $var3     # g,h,i

echo

IFS="-"
# The plus sign reverts to default interpretation.
# The minus sign will be interpreted as a separator.
echo $var1     # a+b+c
echo $var2     # d e f
echo $var3     # g,h,i

echo

IFS=","
# The comma will be interpreted as a separator.
# The minus sign reverts to default interpretation.
echo $var1     # a+b+c
echo $var2     # d-e-f
echo $var3     # g h i

echo

IFS=" "
# The space character will be interpreted as a separator.
# The comma reverts to default interpretation.
echo $var1     # a+b+c
echo $var2     # d-e-f
echo $var3     # g,h,i

# ======================================================== #

# However ...
# $IFS treats whitespace differently than other characters.

output\_args\_one\_per\_line()
{
  for arg
  do
    echo "\[$arg\]"
  done #  ^    ^   Embed within brackets, for your viewing pleasure.
}

echo; echo "IFS=\\" \\""
echo "-------"

IFS=" "
var=" a  b c   "
#    ^ ^^   ^^^
output\_args\_one\_per\_line $var  # output\_args\_one\_per\_line \`echo " a  b c   "\`
# \[a\]
# \[b\]
# \[c\]


echo; echo "IFS=:"
echo "-----"

IFS=:
var=":a::b:c:::"               # Same pattern as above,
#    ^ ^^   ^^^                #+ but substituting ":" for " "  ...
output\_args\_one\_per\_line $var
# \[\]
# \[a\]
# \[\]
# \[b\]
# \[c\]
# \[\]
# \[\]

# Note "empty" brackets.
# The same thing happens with the "FS" field separator in awk.


echo

exit

(Many thanks, StÃ©phane Chazelas, for clarification and above examples.)

See also [Example 16-41](#ISSPAMMER), [Example 11-8](#BINGREP), and [Example 19-14](#MAILBOXGREP) for instructive examples of using $IFS.

$IGNOREEOF

Ignore EOF: how many end-of-files (control-D) the shell will ignore before logging out.

$LC\_COLLATE

Often set in the [.bashrc](#SAMPLE-BASHRC) or /etc/profile files, this variable controls collation order in filename expansion and pattern matching. If mishandled, LC\_COLLATE can cause unexpected results in [filename globbing](#GLOBBINGREF).

![Note](../images/note.gif)

As of version 2.05 of Bash, filename globbing no longer distinguishes between lowercase and uppercase letters in a character range between brackets. For example, **ls \[A-M\]\*** would match both File1.txt and file1.txt. To revert to the customary behavior of bracket matching, set LC\_COLLATE to C by an **export LC\_COLLATE=C** in /etc/profile and/or ~/.bashrc.

$LC\_CTYPE

This internal variable controls character interpretation in [globbing](#GLOBBINGREF) and pattern matching.

$LINENO

This variable is the line number of the shell script in which this variable appears. It has significance only within the script in which it appears, and is chiefly useful for debugging purposes.

\# \*\*\* BEGIN DEBUG BLOCK \*\*\*
last\_cmd\_arg=$\_  # Save it.

echo "At line number $LINENO, variable \\"v1\\" = $v1"
echo "Last command argument processed = $last\_cmd\_arg"
# \*\*\* END DEBUG BLOCK \*\*\*

$MACHTYPE

machine type

Identifies the system hardware.

bash$ **echo $MACHTYPE**
i686

$OLDPWD

Old working directory ("OLD-Print-Working-Directory", previous directory you were in).

$OSTYPE

operating system type

bash$ **echo $OSTYPE**
linux

$PATH

Path to binaries, usually /usr/bin/, /usr/X11R6/bin/, /usr/local/bin, etc.

When given a command, the shell automatically does a hash table search on the directories listed in the _path_ for the executable. The path is stored in the [environmental variable](#ENVREF), $PATH, a list of directories, separated by colons. Normally, the system stores the $PATH definition in /etc/profile and/or [~/.bashrc](#SAMPLE-BASHRC) (see [Appendix H](#FILES)).

bash$ **echo $PATH**
/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin

**PATH=${PATH}:/opt/bin** appends the /opt/bin directory to the current path. In a script, it may be expedient to temporarily add a directory to the path in this way. When the script exits, this restores the original $PATH (a child process, such as a script, may not change the environment of the parent process, the shell).

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The current "working directory", ./, is usually omitted from the $PATH as a security measure.

$PIPESTATUS

[Array](#ARRAYREF) variable holding [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF)(es) of last executed _foreground_ [pipe](#PIPEREF).

bash$ **echo $PIPESTATUS**
0

bash$ **ls -al | bogus\_command**
bash: bogus\_command: command not found
bash$ **echo ${PIPESTATUS\[1\]}**
127

bash$ **ls -al | bogus\_command**
bash: bogus\_command: command not found
bash$ **echo $?**
127
	      

The members of the $PIPESTATUS array hold the exit status of each respective command executed in a pipe. $PIPESTATUS\[0\] holds the exit status of the first command in the pipe, $PIPESTATUS\[1\] the exit status of the second command, and so on.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

The $PIPESTATUS variable may contain an erroneous 0 value in a login shell (in releases prior to 3.0 of Bash).

tcsh% **bash**

bash$ **who | grep nobody | sort**
bash$ **echo ${PIPESTATUS\[\*\]}**
0
	      

The above lines contained in a script would produce the expected 0 1 0 output.

Thank you, Wayne Pollock for pointing this out and supplying the above example.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The $PIPESTATUS variable gives unexpected results in some contexts.

bash$ **echo $BASH\_VERSION**
3.00.14(1)-release

bash$ **$ ls | bogus\_command | wc**
bash: bogus\_command: command not found
 0       0       0

bash$ **echo ${PIPESTATUS\[@\]}**
141 127 0
	      

Chet Ramey attributes the above output to the behavior of [ls](#LSREF). If _ls_ writes to a _pipe_ whose output is not read, then _SIGPIPE_ kills it, and its [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) is 141. Otherwise its exit status is 0, as expected. This likewise is the case for [tr](#TRREF).

![Note](../images/note.gif)

$PIPESTATUS is a "volatile" variable. It needs to be captured immediately after the pipe in question, before any other command intervenes.

bash$ **$ ls | bogus\_command | wc**
bash: bogus\_command: command not found
 0       0       0

bash$ **echo ${PIPESTATUS\[@\]}**
0 127 0

bash$ **echo ${PIPESTATUS\[@\]}**
0
	      

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The [pipefail option](#PIPEFAILREF) may be useful in cases where $PIPESTATUS does not give the desired information.

$PPID

The $PPID of a process is the process ID (pid) of its parent process. [\[42\]](#FTN.AEN5154)

Compare this with the [pidof](#PIDOFREF) command.

$PROMPT\_COMMAND

A variable holding a command to be executed just before the primary prompt, $PS1 is to be displayed.

$PS1

This is the main prompt, seen at the command-line.

$PS2

The secondary prompt, seen when additional input is expected. It displays as ">".

$PS3

The tertiary prompt, displayed in a [select](#SELECTREF) loop (see [Example 11-30](#EX31)).

$PS4

The quartenary prompt, shown at the beginning of each line of output when invoking a script with the \-x _\[verbose trace\]_ [option](#OPTIONSREF). It displays as "+".

As a debugging aid, it may be useful to embed diagnostic information in $PS4.

P4='$(read time junk < /proc/$$/schedstat; echo "@@@ $time @@@ " )'
# Per suggestion by Erik Brandsberg.
set -x
# Various commands follow ...

$PWD

Working directory (directory you are in at the time)

This is the analog to the [pwd](#PWD2REF) builtin command.

#!/bin/bash

E\_WRONG\_DIRECTORY=85

clear # Clear the screen.

TargetDirectory=/home/bozo/projects/GreatAmericanNovel

cd $TargetDirectory
echo "Deleting stale files in $TargetDirectory."

if \[ "$PWD" != "$TargetDirectory" \]
then    # Keep from wiping out wrong directory by accident.
  echo "Wrong directory!"
  echo "In $PWD, rather than $TargetDirectory!"
  echo "Bailing out!"
  exit $E\_WRONG\_DIRECTORY
fi  

rm -rf \*
rm .\[A-Za-z0-9\]\*    # Delete dotfiles.
# rm -f .\[^.\]\* ..?\*   to remove filenames beginning with multiple dots.
# (shopt -s dotglob; rm -f \*)   will also work.
# Thanks, S.C. for pointing this out.

#  A filename (\`basename\`) may contain all characters in the 0 - 255 range,
#+ except "/".
#  Deleting files beginning with weird characters, such as -
#+ is left as an exercise. (Hint: rm ./-weirdname or rm -- -weirdname)
result=$?   # Result of delete operations. If successful = 0.

echo
ls -al              # Any files left?
echo "Done."
echo "Old files deleted in $TargetDirectory."
echo

# Various other operations here, as necessary.

exit $result

$REPLY

The default value when a variable is not supplied to [read](#READREF). Also applicable to [select](#SELECTREF) menus, but only supplies the item number of the variable chosen, not the value of the variable itself.

#!/bin/bash
# reply.sh

# REPLY is the default value for a 'read' command.

echo
echo -n "What is your favorite vegetable? "
read

echo "Your favorite vegetable is $REPLY."
#  REPLY holds the value of last "read" if and only if
#+ no variable supplied.

echo
echo -n "What is your favorite fruit? "
read fruit
echo "Your favorite fruit is $fruit."
echo "but..."
echo "Value of \\$REPLY is still $REPLY."
#  $REPLY is still set to its previous value because
#+ the variable $fruit absorbed the new "read" value.

echo

exit 0

$SECONDS

The number of seconds the script has been running.

#!/bin/bash

TIME\_LIMIT=10
INTERVAL=1

echo
echo "Hit Control-C to exit before $TIME\_LIMIT seconds."
echo

while \[ "$SECONDS" -le "$TIME\_LIMIT" \]
do   #   $SECONDS is an internal shell variable.
  if \[ "$SECONDS" -eq 1 \]
  then
    units=second
  else  
    units=seconds
  fi

  echo "This script has been running $SECONDS $units."
  #  On a slow or overburdened machine, the script may skip a count
  #+ every once in a while.
  sleep $INTERVAL
done

echo -e "\\a"  # Beep!

exit 0

$SHELLOPTS

The list of enabled shell [options](#OPTIONSREF), a readonly variable.

bash$ **echo $SHELLOPTS**
braceexpand:hashall:histexpand:monitor:history:interactive-comments:emacs
	      

$SHLVL

Shell level, how deeply Bash is nested. [\[43\]](#FTN.AEN5320) If, at the command-line, $SHLVL is 1, then in a script it will increment to 2.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

This variable is [_not_ affected by subshells](#SUBSHNLEVREF). Use [$BASH\_SUBSHELL](#BASHSUBSHELLREF) when you need an indication of subshell nesting.

$TMOUT

If the _$TMOUT_ environmental variable is set to a non-zero value time, then the shell prompt will time out after $time seconds. This will cause a logout.

As of version 2.05b of Bash, it is now possible to use _$TMOUT_ in a script in combination with [read](#READREF).

\# Works in scripts for Bash, versions 2.05b and later.

TMOUT=3    # Prompt times out at three seconds.

echo "What is your favorite song?"
echo "Quickly now, you only have $TMOUT seconds to answer!"
read song

if \[ -z "$song" \]
then
  song="(no answer)"
  # Default response.
fi

echo "Your favorite song is $song."

There are other, more complex, ways of implementing timed input in a script. One alternative is to set up a timing loop to signal the script when it times out. This also requires a signal handling routine to [trap](#TRAPREF1) (see [Example 32-5](#EX76)) the interrupt generated by the timing loop (whew!).

**Example 9-2. Timed Input**

#!/bin/bash
# timed-input.sh

# TMOUT=3    Also works, as of newer versions of Bash.

TIMER\_INTERRUPT=14
TIMELIMIT=3  # Three seconds in this instance.
             # May be set to different value.

PrintAnswer()
{
  if \[ "$answer" = TIMEOUT \]
  then
    echo $answer
  else       # Don't want to mix up the two instances. 
    echo "Your favorite veggie is $answer"
    kill $!  #  Kills no-longer-needed TimerOn function
             #+ running in background.
             #  $! is PID of last job running in background.
  fi

}  


TimerOn()
{
  sleep $TIMELIMIT && kill -s 14 $$ &
  # Waits 3 seconds, then sends sigalarm to script.
}  


Int14Vector()
{
  answer="TIMEOUT"
  PrintAnswer
  exit $TIMER\_INTERRUPT
}  

trap Int14Vector $TIMER\_INTERRUPT
# Timer interrupt (14) subverted for our purposes.

echo "What is your favorite vegetable "
TimerOn
read answer
PrintAnswer


#  Admittedly, this is a kludgy implementation of timed input.
#  However, the "-t" option to "read" simplifies this task.
#  See the "t-out.sh" script.
#  However, what about timing not just single user input,
#+ but an entire script?

#  If you need something really elegant ...
#+ consider writing the application in C or C++,
#+ using appropriate library functions, such as 'alarm' and 'setitimer.'

exit 0

An alternative is using [stty](#STTYREF).

**Example 9-3. Once more, timed input**

#!/bin/bash
# timeout.sh

#  Written by Stephane Chazelas,
#+ and modified by the document author.

INTERVAL=5                # timeout interval

timedout\_read() {
  timeout=$1
  varname=$2
  old\_tty\_settings=\`stty -g\`
  stty -icanon min 0 time ${timeout}0
  eval read $varname      # or just  read $varname
  stty "$old\_tty\_settings"
  # See man page for "stty."
}

echo; echo -n "What's your name? Quick! "
timedout\_read $INTERVAL your\_name

#  This may not work on every terminal type.
#  The maximum timeout depends on the terminal.
#+ (it is often 25.5 seconds).

echo

if \[ ! -z "$your\_name" \]  # If name input before timeout ...
then
  echo "Your name is $your\_name."
else
  echo "Timed out."
fi

echo

# The behavior of this script differs somewhat from "timed-input.sh."
# At each keystroke, the counter resets.

exit 0

Perhaps the simplest method is using the \-t option to [read](#READREF).

**Example 9-4. Timed _read_**

#!/bin/bash
# t-out.sh \[time-out\]
# Inspired by a suggestion from "syngin seven" (thanks).


TIMELIMIT=4         # 4 seconds

read -t $TIMELIMIT variable <&1
#                           ^^^
#  In this instance, "<&1" is needed for Bash 1.x and 2.x,
#  but unnecessary for Bash 3+.

echo

if \[ -z "$variable" \]  # Is null?
then
  echo "Timed out, variable still unset."
else  
  echo "variable = $variable"
fi  

exit 0

$UID

User ID number

Current user's user identification number, as recorded in [/etc/passwd](#DATAFILESREF1)

This is the current user's real id, even if she has temporarily assumed another identity through [su](#SUREF). $UID is a readonly variable, not subject to change from the command line or within a script, and is the counterpart to the [id](#IDREF) builtin.

**Example 9-5. Am I root?**

#!/bin/bash
# am-i-root.sh:   Am I root or not?

ROOT\_UID=0   # Root has $UID 0.

if \[ "$UID" -eq "$ROOT\_UID" \]  # Will the real "root" please stand up?
then
  echo "You are root."
else
  echo "You are just an ordinary user (but mom loves you just the same)."
fi

exit 0


# ============================================================= #
# Code below will not execute, because the script already exited.

# An alternate method of getting to the root of matters:

ROOTUSER\_NAME=root

username=\`id -nu\`              # Or...   username=\`whoami\`
if \[ "$username" = "$ROOTUSER\_NAME" \]
then
  echo "Rooty, toot, toot. You are root."
else
  echo "You are just a regular fella."
fi

See also [Example 2-3](#EX2).

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The variables $ENV, $LOGNAME, $MAIL, $TERM, $USER, and $USERNAME are _not_ Bash [builtins](#BUILTINREF). These are, however, often set as [environmental variables](#ENVREF) in one of the [Bash](#FILESREF1) or _login_ startup files. $SHELL, the name of the user's login shell, may be set from /etc/passwd or in an "init" script, and it is likewise not a Bash builtin.

tcsh% **echo $LOGNAME**
bozo
tcsh% **echo $SHELL**
/bin/tcsh
tcsh% **echo $TERM**
rxvt

bash$ **echo $LOGNAME**
bozo
bash$ **echo $SHELL**
/bin/tcsh
bash$ **echo $TERM**
rxvt
	      

**Positional Parameters**

$0, $1, $2, etc.

Positional parameters, passed from command line to script, passed to a function, or [set](#SETREF) to a variable (see [Example 4-5](#EX17) and [Example 15-16](#EX34))

$#

Number of command-line arguments [\[44\]](#FTN.AEN5479) or positional parameters (see [Example 36-2](#EX4))

$\*

All of the positional parameters, seen as a single word

![Note](../images/note.gif)

"$\*" must be quoted.

$@

Same as $\*, but each parameter is a quoted string, that is, the parameters are passed on intact, without interpretation or expansion. This means, among other things, that each parameter in the argument list is seen as a separate word.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Of course, "$@" should be quoted.

**Example 9-6. _arglist_: Listing arguments with $\* and $@**

#!/bin/bash
# arglist.sh
# Invoke this script with several arguments, such as "one two three" ...

E\_BADARGS=85

if \[ ! -n "$1" \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` argument1 argument2 etc."
  exit $E\_BADARGS
fi  

echo

index=1          # Initialize count.

echo "Listing args with \\"\\$\*\\":"
for arg in "$\*"  # Doesn't work properly if "$\*" isn't quoted.
do
  echo "Arg #$index = $arg"
  let "index+=1"
done             # $\* sees all arguments as single word. 
echo "Entire arg list seen as single word."

echo

index=1          # Reset count.
                 # What happens if you forget to do this?

echo "Listing args with \\"\\$@\\":"
for arg in "$@"
do
  echo "Arg #$index = $arg"
  let "index+=1"
done             # $@ sees arguments as separate words. 
echo "Arg list seen as separate words."

echo

index=1          # Reset count.

echo "Listing args with \\$\* (unquoted):"
for arg in $\*
do
  echo "Arg #$index = $arg"
  let "index+=1"
done             # Unquoted $\* sees arguments as separate words. 
echo "Arg list seen as separate words."

exit 0

Following a **shift**, the $@ holds the remaining command-line parameters, lacking the previous $1, which was lost.

#!/bin/bash
# Invoke with ./scriptname 1 2 3 4 5

echo "$@"    # 1 2 3 4 5
shift
echo "$@"    # 2 3 4 5
shift
echo "$@"    # 3 4 5

# Each "shift" loses parameter $1.
# "$@" then contains the remaining parameters.

The $@ special parameter finds use as a tool for filtering input into shell scripts. The **cat "$@"** construction accepts input to a script either from stdin or from files given as parameters to the script. See [Example 16-24](#ROT13) and [Example 16-25](#CRYPTOQUOTE).

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

The $\* and $@ parameters sometimes display inconsistent and puzzling behavior, depending on the setting of [$IFS](#IFSREF).

**Example 9-7. Inconsistent $\* and $@ behavior**

#!/bin/bash

#  Erratic behavior of the "$\*" and "$@" internal Bash variables,
#+ depending on whether or not they are quoted.
#  Demonstrates inconsistent handling of word splitting and linefeeds.


set -- "First one" "second" "third:one" "" "Fifth: :one"

The **$@** and **$\*** parameters differ only when between double quotes.

**Example 9-8. $\* and $@ when $IFS is empty**

#!/bin/bash

#  If $IFS set, but empty,
#+ then "$\*" and "$@" do not echo positional params as expected.

mecho ()       # Echo positional parameters.
{
echo "$1,$2,$3";
}


IFS=""         # Set, but empty.
set a b c      # Positional parameters.

mecho "$\*"     # abc,,
#                   ^^
mecho $\*       # a,b,c

mecho $@       # a,b,c
mecho "$@"     # a,b,c

#  The behavior of $\* and $@ when $IFS is empty depends
#+ on which Bash or sh version being run.
#  It is therefore inadvisable to depend on this "feature" in a script.


# Thanks, Stephane Chazelas.

exit

**Other Special Parameters**

$-

Flags passed to script (using [set](#SETREF)). See [Example 15-16](#EX34).

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

This was originally a _ksh_ construct adopted into Bash, and unfortunately it does not seem to work reliably in Bash scripts. One possible use for it is to have a script [self-test whether it is interactive](#IITEST).

$!

[PID](#PROCESSIDDEF) (process ID) of last job run in background

LOG=$0.log

COMMAND1="sleep 100"

echo "Logging PIDs background commands for script: $0" >> "$LOG"
# So they can be monitored, and killed as necessary.
echo >> "$LOG"

# Logging commands.

echo -n "PID of \\"$COMMAND1\\":  " >> "$LOG"
${COMMAND1} &
echo $! >> "$LOG"
# PID of "sleep 100":  1506

# Thank you, Jacques Lederer, for suggesting this.

Using $! for job control:

possibly\_hanging\_job & { sleep ${TIMEOUT}; eval 'kill -9 $!' &> /dev/null; }
# Forces completion of an ill-behaved program.
# Useful, for example, in init scripts.

# Thank you, Sylvain Fourmanoit, for this creative use of the "!" variable.

Or, alternately:

\# This example by Matthew Sage.
# Used with permission.

TIMEOUT=30   # Timeout value in seconds
count=0

possibly\_hanging\_job & {
        while ((count < TIMEOUT )); do
                eval '\[ ! -d "/proc/$!" \] && ((count = TIMEOUT))'
                # /proc is where information about running processes is found.
                # "-d" tests whether it exists (whether directory exists).
                # So, we're waiting for the job in question to show up.

#  In such a case, the wrong job may be killed.
#  Ariel Meragelman suggests the following fix.

TIMEOUT=30

$\_

Special variable set to final argument of previous command executed.

**Example 9-9. Underscore variable**

#!/bin/bash

echo $\_              #  /bin/bash
                     #  Just called /bin/bash to run the script.

:
echo $\_              #  :

$?

[Exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) of a command, [function](#FUNCTIONREF), or the script itself (see [Example 24-7](#MAX))

$$

Process ID (_PID_) of the script itself. [\[45\]](#FTN.AEN5654) The $$ variable often finds use in scripts to construct "unique" temp file names (see [Example 32-6](#ONLINE), [Example 16-31](#DERPM), and [Example 15-27](#SELFDESTRUCT)). This is usually simpler than invoking [mktemp](#MKTEMPREF).

* * *

9.2. Typing variables: **declare** or **typeset**
=================================================

The _declare_ or _typeset_ [builtins](#BUILTINREF), which are exact synonyms, permit modifying the properties of variables. This is a very weak form of the _typing_ [\[46\]](#FTN.AEN5685) available in certain programming languages. The _declare_ command is specific to version 2 or later of Bash. The _typeset_ command also works in ksh scripts.

**declare/typeset options**

\-r _readonly_

(**declare -r var1** works the same as **readonly var1**)

This is the rough equivalent of the **C** _const_ type qualifier. An attempt to change the value of a _readonly_ variable fails with an error message.

declare -r var1=1
echo "var1 = $var1"   # var1 = 1

(( var1++ ))          # x.sh: line 4: var1: readonly variable

\-i _integer_

declare -i number
# The script will treat subsequent occurrences of "number" as an integer.		

number=3
echo "Number = $number"     # Number = 3

number=three
echo "Number = $number"     # Number = 0
# Tries to evaluate the string "three" as an integer.

Certain arithmetic operations are permitted for declared integer variables without the need for [expr](#EXPRREF) or [let](#LETREF).

n=6/3
echo "n = $n"       # n = 6/3

declare -i n
n=6/3
echo "n = $n"       # n = 2

\-a _array_

declare -a indices

The variable _indices_ will be treated as an [array](#ARRAYREF).

\-f _function(s)_

declare -f

A **declare -f** line with no arguments in a script causes a listing of all the [functions](#FUNCTIONREF) previously defined in that script.

declare -f function\_name

A **declare -f function\_name** in a script lists just the function named.

\-x [export](#EXPORTREF)

declare -x var3

This declares a variable as available for exporting outside the environment of the script itself.

\-x var=$value

declare -x var3=373

The **declare** command permits assigning a value to a variable in the same statement as setting its properties.

**Example 9-10. Using _declare_ to type variables**

#!/bin/bash

func1 ()
{
  echo This is a function.
}

declare -f        # Lists the function above.

echo

declare -i var1   # var1 is an integer.
var1=2367
echo "var1 declared as $var1"
var1=var1+1       # Integer declaration eliminates the need for 'let'.
echo "var1 incremented by 1 is $var1."
# Attempt to change variable declared as integer.
echo "Attempting to change var1 to floating point value, 2367.1."
var1=2367.1       # Results in error message, with no change to variable.
echo "var1 is still $var1"

echo

declare -r var2=13.36         # 'declare' permits setting a variable property
                              #+ and simultaneously assigning it a value.
echo "var2 declared as $var2" # Attempt to change readonly variable.
var2=13.37                    # Generates error message, and exit from script.

echo "var2 is still $var2"    # This line will not execute.

exit 0                        # Script will not exit here.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Using the _declare_ builtin restricts the [scope](#SCOPEREF) of a variable.

9.2.1. Another use for _declare_
--------------------------------

The _declare_ command can be helpful in identifying variables, [environmental](#ENVREF) or otherwise. This can be especially useful with [arrays](#ARRAYREF).

bash$ **declare | grep HOME**
HOME=/home/bozo

bash$ **zzy=68**
bash$ **declare | grep zzy**
zzy=68

bash$ **Colors=(\[0\]="purple" \[1\]="reddish-orange" \[2\]="light green")**
bash$ **echo ${Colors\[@\]}**
purple reddish-orange light green
bash$ **declare | grep Colors**
Colors=(\[0\]="purple" \[1\]="reddish-orange" \[2\]="light green")

9.3. $RANDOM: generate random integer
=====================================

Â 

_

_Anyone who attempts to generate random numbers by deterministic means is, of course, living in a state of sin._

_\--John von Neumann_

_

$RANDOM is an internal Bash [function](#FUNCTIONREF) (not a constant) that returns a _pseudorandom_ [\[47\]](#FTN.AEN5817) integer in the range 0 - 32767. It should _not_ be used to generate an encryption key.

**Example 9-11. Generating random numbers**

#!/bin/bash

# $RANDOM returns a different random integer at each invocation.
# Nominal range: 0 - 32767 (signed 16-bit integer).

MAXCOUNT=10
count=1

echo
echo "$MAXCOUNT random numbers:"
echo "-----------------"
while \[ "$count" -le $MAXCOUNT \]      # Generate 10 ($MAXCOUNT) random integers.
do
  number=$RANDOM
  echo $number
  let "count += 1"  # Increment count.
done
echo "-----------------"

# If you need a random int within a certain range, use the 'modulo' operator.
# This returns the remainder of a division operation.

RANGE=500

echo

number=$RANDOM
let "number %= $RANGE"
#           ^^
echo "Random number less than $RANGE  ---  $number"

echo



#  If you need a random integer greater than a lower bound,
#+ then set up a test to discard all numbers below that.

FLOOR=200

number=0   #initialize
while \[ "$number" -le $FLOOR \]
do
  number=$RANDOM
done
echo "Random number greater than $FLOOR ---  $number"
echo

   # Let's examine a simple alternative to the above loop, namely
   #       let "number = $RANDOM + $FLOOR"
   # That would eliminate the while-loop and run faster.
   # But, there might be a problem with that. What is it?



# Combine above two techniques to retrieve random number between two limits.
number=0   #initialize
while \[ "$number" -le $FLOOR \]
do
  number=$RANDOM
  let "number %= $RANGE"  # Scales $number down within $RANGE.
done
echo "Random number between $FLOOR and $RANGE ---  $number"
echo



# Generate binary choice, that is, "true" or "false" value.
BINARY=2
T=1
number=$RANDOM

let "number %= $BINARY"
#  Note that    let "number >>= 14"    gives a better random distribution
#+ (right shifts out everything except last binary digit).
if \[ "$number" -eq $T \]
then
  echo "TRUE"
else
  echo "FALSE"
fi  

echo


# Generate a toss of the dice.
SPOTS=6   # Modulo 6 gives range 0 - 5.
          # Incrementing by 1 gives desired range of 1 - 6.
          # Thanks, Paulo Marcel Coelho Aragao, for the simplification.
die1=0
die2=0
# Would it be better to just set SPOTS=7 and not add 1? Why or why not?

# Tosses each die separately, and so gives correct odds.

    let "die1 = $RANDOM % $SPOTS +1" # Roll first one.
    let "die2 = $RANDOM % $SPOTS +1" # Roll second one.
    #  Which arithmetic operation, above, has greater precedence --
    #+ modulo (%) or addition (+)?


let "throw = $die1 + $die2"
echo "Throw of the dice = $throw"
echo

#  This script models Brownian motion:
#+ the random wanderings of tiny particles in a fluid,
#+ as they are buffeted by random currents and collisions.
#+ This is colloquially known as the "Drunkard's Walk."

#  It can also be considered as a stripped-down simulation of a
#+ Galton Board, a slanted board with a pattern of pegs,
#+ down which rolls a succession of marbles, one at a time.
#+ At the bottom is a row of slots or catch basins in which
#+ the marbles come to rest at the end of their journey.
#  Think of it as a kind of bare-bones Pachinko game.
#  As you see by running the script,
#+ most of the marbles cluster around the center slot.
#+ This is consistent with the expected binomial distribution.
#  As a Galton Board simulation, the script
#+ disregards such parameters as

_Jipe_ points out a set of techniques for generating random numbers within a range.

\#  Generate random number between 6 and 30.
   rnumber=$((RANDOM%25+6))	

#  Generate random number in the same 6 - 30 range,
#+ but the number must be evenly divisible by 3.
   rnumber=$(((RANDOM%30/3+1)\*3))

#  Note that this will not work all the time.
#  It fails if $RANDOM%30 returns 0.

#  Frank Wang suggests the following alternative:
   rnumber=$(( RANDOM%27/3\*3+6 ))

_Bill Gradwohl_ came up with an improved formula that works for positive numbers.

rnumber=$(((RANDOM%(max-min+divisibleBy))/divisibleBy\*divisibleBy+min))

Here Bill presents a versatile function that returns a random number between two specified values.

Just how random is $RANDOM? The best way to test this is to write a script that tracks the distribution of "random" numbers generated by $RANDOM. Let's roll a $RANDOM die a few times . . .

**Example 9-15. Rolling a single die with RANDOM**

#!/bin/bash
# How random is RANDOM?

RANDOM=$$       # Reseed the random number generator using script process ID.

PIPS=6          # A die has 6 pips.
MAXTHROWS=600   # Increase this if you have nothing better to do with your time.
throw=0         # Number of times the dice have been cast.

ones=0          #  Must initialize counts to zero,
twos=0          #+ since an uninitialized variable is null, NOT zero.
threes=0
fours=0
fives=0
sixes=0

print\_result ()
{
echo
echo "ones =   $ones"
echo "twos =   $twos"
echo "threes = $threes"
echo "fours =  $fours"
echo "fives =  $fives"
echo "sixes =  $sixes"
echo
}

update\_count()
{
case "$1" in
  0) ((ones++));;   # Since a die has no "zero", this corresponds to 1.
  1) ((twos++));;   # And this to 2.
  2) ((threes++));; # And so forth.
  3) ((fours++));;
  4) ((fives++));;
  5) ((sixes++));;
esac
}

echo


while \[ "$throw" -lt "$MAXTHROWS" \]
do
  let "die1 = RANDOM % $PIPS"
  update\_count $die1
  let "throw += 1"
done  

print\_result

exit $?

#  The scores should distribute evenly, assuming RANDOM is random.
#  With $MAXTHROWS at 600, all should cluster around 100,
#+ plus-or-minus 20 or so.
#
#  Keep in mind that RANDOM is a \*\*\*pseudorandom\*\*\* generator,
#+ and not a spectacularly good one at that.

#  Randomness is a deep and complex subject.
#  Sufficiently long "random" sequences may exhibit
#+ chaotic and other "non-random" behavior.

# Exercise (easy):
# ---------------
# Rewrite this script to flip a coin 1000 times.
# Choices are "HEADS" and "TAILS."

As we have seen in the last example, it is best to _reseed_ the _RANDOM_ generator each time it is invoked. Using the same seed for _RANDOM_ repeats the same series of numbers. [\[48\]](#FTN.AEN5857) (This mirrors the behavior of the _random()_ function in _C_.)

**Example 9-16. Reseeding RANDOM**

#!/bin/bash
# seeding-random.sh: Seeding the RANDOM variable.
# v 1.1, reldate 09 Feb 2013

MAXCOUNT=25       # How many numbers to generate.
SEED=

random\_numbers ()

local count=0
local number

while \[ "$count" -lt "$MAXCOUNT" \]

  number=$RANDOM
  echo -n "$number "
  let "count++"

RANDOM=$SEED      # Setting RANDOM seeds the random number generator.

random\_numbers


RANDOM=$SEED      # Same seed for RANDOM . . .
echo; echo "Again, with same random seed ..."
echo "Random seed = $SEED"
random\_numbers    # . . . reproduces the exact same number series.
                  #
                  # When is it useful to duplicate a "random" series?

echo; echo

SEED=2
RANDOM=$SEED      # Trying again, but with a different seed . . .
echo "Random seed = $SEED"
random\_numbers    # . . . gives a different number series.

echo; echo

# RANDOM=$$  seeds RANDOM from process id of script.
# It is also possible to seed RANDOM from 'time' or 'date' commands.

# Getting fancy...
SEED=$(head -1 /dev/urandom | od -N 1 | awk '{ print $2 }'| sed s/^0\*//)
#  Pseudo-random output fetched
#+ from /dev/urandom (system pseudo-random device-file),
#+ then converted to line of printable (octal) numbers by "od",
#+ then "awk" retrieves just one number for SEED,
#+ finally "sed" removes any leading zeros.
RANDOM=$SEED
echo "Random seed = $SEED"
random\_numbers

echo; echo

exit 0

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The /dev/urandom pseudo-device file provides a method of generating much more "random" pseudorandom numbers than the $RANDOM variable. **dd if=/dev/urandom of=targetfile bs=1 count=XX** creates a file of well-scattered pseudorandom numbers. However, assigning these numbers to a variable in a script requires a workaround, such as filtering through [od](#ODREF) (as in above example, [Example 16-14](#RND), and [Example A-36](#INSERTIONSORT)), or even piping to [md5sum](#MD5SUMREF) (see [Example 36-16](#HORSERACE)).

There are also other ways to generate pseudorandom numbers in a script. **Awk** provides a convenient means of doing this.

**Example 9-17. Pseudorandom numbers, using [awk](#AWKREF)**

#!/bin/bash
#  random2.sh: Returns a pseudorandom number in the range 0 - 1,
#+ to 6 decimal places. For example: 0.822725
#  Uses the awk rand() function.

AWKSCRIPT=' { srand(); print rand() } '
#           Command(s)/parameters passed to awk
# Note that srand() reseeds awk's random number generator.


echo -n "Random number between 0 and 1 = "

echo | awk "$AWKSCRIPT"
# What happens if you leave out the 'echo'?

exit 0


# Exercises:
# ---------

# 1) Using a loop construct, print out 10 different random numbers.
#      (Hint: you must reseed the srand() function with a different seed
#+     in each pass through the loop. What happens if you omit this?)

# 2) Using an integer multiplier as a scaling factor, generate random numbers 
#+   in the range of 10 to 100.

# 3) Same as exercise #2, above, but generate random integers this time.

The [date](#DATEREF) command also lends itself to [generating pseudorandom integer sequences](#DATERANDREF).

Chapter 10. Manipulating Variables
==================================

10.1. Manipulating Strings
==========================

Bash supports a surprising number of string manipulation operations. Unfortunately, these tools lack a unified focus. Some are a subset of [parameter substitution](#PARAMSUBREF), and others fall under the functionality of the UNIX [expr](#EXPRREF) command. This results in inconsistent command syntax and overlap of functionality, not to mention confusion.

**String Length**

${#string}

expr length $string

These are the equivalent of _strlen()_ in _C_.

expr "$string" : '.\*'

stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc

echo ${#stringZ}                 # 15
echo \`expr length $stringZ\`      # 15
echo \`expr "$stringZ" : '.\*'\`    # 15

**Example 10-1. Inserting a blank line between paragraphs in a text file**

#!/bin/bash
# paragraph-space.sh
# Ver. 2.1, Reldate 29Jul12 \[fixup\]

# Inserts a blank line between paragraphs of a single-spaced text file.
# Usage: $0 <FILENAME

MINLEN=60        # Change this value? It's a judgment call.
#  Assume lines shorter than $MINLEN characters ending in a period
#+ terminate a paragraph. See exercises below.

while read line  # For as many lines as the input file has ...
do
  echo "$line"   # Output the line itself.

  len=${#line}
  if \[\[ "$len" -lt "$MINLEN" && "$line" =~ \[\*{\\.}\]$ \]\]
# if \[\[ "$len" -lt "$MINLEN" && "$line" =~ \\\[\*\\.\\\] \]\]
# An update to Bash broke the previous version of this script. Ouch!
# Thank you, Halim Srama, for pointing this out and suggesting a fix.
    then echo    #  Add a blank line immediately
  fi             #+ after a short line terminated by a period.
done

exit

# Exercises:
# ---------
#  1) The script usually inserts a blank line at the end
#+    of the target file. Fix this.
#  2) Line 17 only considers periods as sentence terminators.
#     Modify this to include other common end-of-sentence characters,
#+    such as ?, !, and ".

**Length of Matching Substring at Beginning of String**

expr match "$string" '$substring'

_$substring_ is a [regular expression](#REGEXREF).

expr "$string" : '$substring'

_$substring_ is a regular expression.

stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc
#       |------|
#       12345678

echo \`expr match "$stringZ" 'abc\[A-Z\]\*.2'\`   # 8
echo \`expr "$stringZ" : 'abc\[A-Z\]\*.2'\`       # 8

**Index**

expr index $string $substring

Numerical position in $string of first character in $substring that matches.

stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc
#       123456 ...
echo \`expr index "$stringZ" C12\`             # 6
                                             # C position.

echo \`expr index "$stringZ" 1c\`              # 3
# 'c' (in #3 position) matches before '1'.

This is the near equivalent of _strchr()_ in _C_.

**Substring Extraction**

${string:position}

Extracts substring from _$string_ at _$position_.

If the $string parameter is "\*" or "@", then this extracts the [positional parameters](#POSPARAMREF), [\[49\]](#FTN.AEN5987) starting at $position.

${string:position:length}

Extracts _$length_ characters of substring from _$string_ at _$position_.

stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc
#       0123456789.....
#       0-based indexing.

echo ${stringZ:0}                            # abcABC123ABCabc
echo ${stringZ:1}                            # bcABC123ABCabc
echo ${stringZ:7}                            # 23ABCabc

echo ${stringZ:7:3}                          # 23A
                                             # Three characters of substring.



# Is it possible to index from the right end of the string?
    
echo ${stringZ:-4}                           # abcABC123ABCabc
# Defaults to full string, as in ${parameter:-default}.
# However . . .

echo ${stringZ:(-4)}                         # Cabc 
echo ${stringZ: -4}                          # Cabc
# Now, it works.
# Parentheses or added space "escape" the position parameter.

# Thank you, Dan Jacobson, for pointing this out.

The _position_ and _length_ arguments can be "parameterized," that is, represented as a variable, rather than as a numerical constant.

**Example 10-2. Generating an 8-character "random" string**

#!/bin/bash
# rand-string.sh
# Generating an 8-character "random" string.

if \[ -n "$1" \]  #  If command-line argument present,
then            #+ then set start-string to it.
  str0="$1"
else            #  Else use PID of script as start-string.
  str0="$$"
fi

POS=2  # Starting from position 2 in the string.
LEN=8  # Extract eight characters.

str1=$( echo "$str0" | md5sum | md5sum )
#  Doubly scramble     ^^^^^^   ^^^^^^
#+ by piping and repiping to md5sum.

randstring="${str1:$POS:$LEN}"
# Can parameterize ^^^^ ^^^^

echo "$randstring"

exit $?

# bozo$ ./rand-string.sh my-password
# 1bdd88c4

#  No, this is is not recommended
#+ as a method of generating hack-proof passwords.

If the $string parameter is "\*" or "@", then this extracts a maximum of $length positional parameters, starting at $position.

echo ${\*:2}          # Echoes second and following positional parameters.
echo ${@:2}          # Same as above.

echo ${\*:2:3}        # Echoes three positional parameters, starting at second.

expr substr $string $position $length

Extracts _$length_ characters from _$string_ starting at _$position_.

stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc
#       123456789......
#       1-based indexing.

echo \`expr substr $stringZ 1 2\`              # ab
echo \`expr substr $stringZ 4 3\`              # ABC

expr match "$string" '\\($substring\\)'

Extracts _$substring_ at beginning of _$string_, where _$substring_ is a [regular expression](#REGEXREF).

expr "$string" : '\\($substring\\)'

Extracts _$substring_ at beginning of _$string_, where _$substring_ is a regular expression.

stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc
#       =======	    

echo \`expr match "$stringZ" '\\(.\[b-c\]\*\[A-Z\]..\[0-9\]\\)'\`   # abcABC1
echo \`expr "$stringZ" : '\\(.\[b-c\]\*\[A-Z\]..\[0-9\]\\)'\`       # abcABC1
echo \`expr "$stringZ" : '\\(.......\\)'\`                   # abcABC1
# All of the above forms give an identical result.

expr match "$string" '.\*\\($substring\\)'

Extracts _$substring_ at _end_ of _$string_, where _$substring_ is a regular expression.

expr "$string" : '.\*\\($substring\\)'

Extracts _$substring_ at _end_ of _$string_, where _$substring_ is a regular expression.

stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc
#                ======

echo \`expr match "$stringZ" '.\*\\(\[A-C\]\[A-C\]\[A-C\]\[a-c\]\*\\)'\`    # ABCabc
echo \`expr "$stringZ" : '.\*\\(......\\)'\`                       # ABCabc

**Substring Removal**

${string#substring}

Deletes shortest match of _$substring_ from _front_ of _$string_.

${string##substring}

Deletes longest match of _$substring_ from _front_ of _$string_.

stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc
#       |----|          shortest
#       |----------|    longest

echo ${stringZ#a\*C}      # 123ABCabc
# Strip out shortest match between 'a' and 'C'.

echo ${stringZ##a\*C}     # abc
# Strip out longest match between 'a' and 'C'.



# You can parameterize the substrings.

X='a\*C'

echo ${stringZ#$X}      # 123ABCabc
echo ${stringZ##$X}     # abc
                        # As above.

${string%substring}

Deletes shortest match of _$substring_ from _back_ of _$string_.

For example:

\# Rename all filenames in $PWD with "TXT" suffix to a "txt" suffix.
# For example, "file1.TXT" becomes "file1.txt" . . .

SUFF=TXT
suff=txt

for i in $(ls \*.$SUFF)
do
  mv -f $i ${i%.$SUFF}.$suff
  #  Leave unchanged everything \*except\* the shortest pattern match
  #+ starting from the right-hand-side of the variable $i . . .
done ### This could be condensed into a "one-liner" if desired.

# Thank you, Rory Winston.

${string%%substring}

Deletes longest match of _$substring_ from _back_ of _$string_.

stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc
#                    ||     shortest
#        |------------|     longest

echo ${stringZ%b\*c}      # abcABC123ABCa
# Strip out shortest match between 'b' and 'c', from back of $stringZ.

echo ${stringZ%%b\*c}     # a
# Strip out longest match between 'b' and 'c', from back of $stringZ.

This operator is useful for generating filenames.

**Example 10-3. Converting graphic file formats, with filename change**

#!/bin/bash
#  cvt.sh:
#  Converts all the MacPaint image files in a directory to "pbm" format.

#  Uses the "macptopbm" binary from the "netpbm" package,
#+ which is maintained by Brian Henderson (bryanh@giraffe-data.com).
#  Netpbm is a standard part of most Linux distros.

OPERATION=macptopbm
SUFFIX=pbm          # New filename suffix. 

if \[ -n "$1" \]
then
  directory=$1      # If directory name given as a script argument...
else
  directory=$PWD    # Otherwise use current working directory.
fi  
  
#  Assumes all files in the target directory are MacPaint image files,
#+ with a ".mac" filename suffix.

for file in $directory/\*    # Filename globbing.
do
  filename=${file%.\*c}      #  Strip ".mac" suffix off filename
                            #+ ('.\*c' matches everything
			    #+ between '.' and 'c', inclusive).
  $OPERATION $file > "$filename.$SUFFIX"
                            # Redirect conversion to new filename.
  rm -f $file               # Delete original files after converting.   
  echo "$filename.$SUFFIX"  # Log what is happening to stdout.
done

exit 0

# Exercise:
# --------
#  As it stands, this script converts \*all\* the files in the current
#+ working directory.
#  Modify it to work \*only\* on files with a ".mac" suffix.



# \*\*\* And here's another way to do it. \*\*\* #

#!/bin/bash
# Batch convert into different graphic formats.
# Assumes imagemagick installed (standard in most Linux distros).

INFMT=png   # Can be tif, jpg, gif, etc.
OUTFMT=pdf  # Can be tif, jpg, gif, pdf, etc.

for pic in \*"$INFMT"
do
  p2=$(ls "$pic" | sed -e s/\\.$INFMT//)
  # echo $p2
    convert "$pic" $p2.$OUTFMT
    done

exit $?

**Example 10-4. Converting streaming audio files to _ogg_**

#!/bin/bash
# ra2ogg.sh: Convert streaming audio files (\*.ra) to ogg.

# Uses the "mplayer" media player program:
#      http://www.mplayerhq.hu/homepage
# Uses the "ogg" library and "oggenc":
#      http://www.xiph.org/
#
# This script may need appropriate codecs installed, such as sipr.so ...
# Possibly also the compat-libstdc++ package.


OFILEPREF=${1%%ra}      # Strip off the "ra" suffix.
OFILESUFF=wav           # Suffix for wav file.
OUTFILE="$OFILEPREF""$OFILESUFF"
E\_NOARGS=85

if \[ -z "$1" \]          # Must specify a filename to convert.
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` \[filename\]"
  exit $E\_NOARGS
fi


##########################################################################
mplayer "$1" -ao pcm:file=$OUTFILE
oggenc "$OUTFILE"  # Correct file extension automatically added by oggenc.
##########################################################################

rm "$OUTFILE"      # Delete intermediate \*.wav file.
                   # If you want to keep it, comment out above line.

exit $?

#  Note:
#  ----
#  On a Website, simply clicking on a \*.ram streaming audio file
#+ usually only downloads the URL of the actual \*.ra audio file.
#  You can then use "wget" or something similar
#+ to download the \*.ra file itself.


#  Exercises:
#  ---------
#  As is, this script converts only \*.ra filenames.
#  Add flexibility by permitting use of \*.ram and other filenames.
#
#  If you're really ambitious, expand the script
#+ to do automatic downloads and conversions of streaming audio files.
#  Given a URL, batch download streaming audio files (using "wget")
#+ and convert them on the fly.

**Substring Replacement**

${string/substring/replacement}

Replace first _match_ of _$substring_ with _$replacement_. [\[50\]](#FTN.AEN6164)

${string//substring/replacement}

Replace all matches of _$substring_ with _$replacement_.

stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc

echo ${stringZ/abc/xyz}       # xyzABC123ABCabc
                              # Replaces first match of 'abc' with 'xyz'.

echo ${stringZ//abc/xyz}      # xyzABC123ABCxyz
                              # Replaces all matches of 'abc' with # 'xyz'.

echo  ---------------
echo "$stringZ"               # abcABC123ABCabc
echo  ---------------
                              # The string itself is not altered!

# Can the match and replacement strings be parameterized?
match=abc
repl=000
echo ${stringZ/$match/$repl}  # 000ABC123ABCabc
#              ^      ^         ^^^
echo ${stringZ//$match/$repl} # 000ABC123ABC000
# Yes!          ^      ^        ^^^         ^^^

echo

# What happens if no $replacement string is supplied?
echo ${stringZ/abc}           # ABC123ABCabc
echo ${stringZ//abc}          # ABC123ABC
# A simple deletion takes place.

${string/#substring/replacement}

If _$substring_ matches _front_ end of _$string_, substitute _$replacement_ for _$substring_.

${string/%substring/replacement}

If _$substring_ matches _back_ end of _$string_, substitute _$replacement_ for _$substring_.

stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc

echo ${stringZ/#abc/XYZ}          # XYZABC123ABCabc
                                  # Replaces front-end match of 'abc' with 'XYZ'.

echo ${stringZ/%abc/XYZ}          # abcABC123ABCXYZ
                                  # Replaces back-end match of 'abc' with 'XYZ'.

10.1.1. Manipulating strings using awk
--------------------------------------

A Bash script may invoke the string manipulation facilities of [awk](#AWKREF) as an alternative to using its built-in operations.

**Example 10-6. Alternate ways of extracting and locating substrings**

#!/bin/bash
# substring-extraction.sh

String=23skidoo1
#      012345678    Bash
#      123456789    awk
# Note different string indexing system:
# Bash numbers first character of string as 0.
# Awk  numbers first character of string as 1.

echo ${String:2:4} # position 3 (0-1-2), 4 characters long
                                         # skid

# The awk equivalent of ${string:pos:length} is substr(string,pos,length).
echo | awk '
{ print substr("'"${String}"'",3,4)      # skid
}
'
#  Piping an empty "echo" to awk gives it dummy input,
#+ and thus makes it unnecessary to supply a filename.

echo "----"

# And likewise:

echo | awk '
{ print index("'"${String}"'", "skid")      # 3
}                                           # (skid starts at position 3)
'   # The awk equivalent of "expr index" ...

exit 0

10.2. Parameter Substitution
============================

**Manipulating and/or expanding variables**

**${parameter}**

Same as _$parameter_, i.e., value of the variable _parameter_. In certain contexts, only the less ambiguous _${parameter}_ form works.

May be used for concatenating variables with strings.

your\_id=${USER}-on-${HOSTNAME}
echo "$your\_id"
#
echo "Old \\$PATH = $PATH"
PATH=${PATH}:/opt/bin  # Add /opt/bin to $PATH for duration of script.
echo "New \\$PATH = $PATH"

**${parameter-default}**, **${parameter:-default}**

If parameter not set, use default.

var1=1
var2=2
# var3 is unset.

echo ${var1-$var2}   # 1
echo ${var3-$var2}   # 2
#           ^          Note the $ prefix.



echo ${username-\`whoami\`}
# Echoes the result of \`whoami\`, if variable $username is still unset.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

_${parameter-default}_ and _${parameter:-default}_ are almost equivalent. The extra : makes a difference only when _parameter_ has been declared, but is null.

#!/bin/bash
# param-sub.sh

#  Whether a variable has been declared
#+ affects triggering of the default option
#+ even if the variable is null.

username0=
echo "username0 has been declared, but is set to null."
echo "username0 = ${username0-\`whoami\`}"
# Will not echo.

echo

echo username1 has not been declared.
echo "username1 = ${username1-\`whoami\`}"
# Will echo.

username2=
echo "username2 has been declared, but is set to null."
echo "username2 = ${username2:-\`whoami\`}"
#                            ^
# Will echo because of :- rather than just - in condition test.
# Compare to first instance, above.


#

# Once again:

variable=
# variable has been declared, but is set to null.

echo "${variable-0}"    # (no output)
echo "${variable:-1}"   # 1
#               ^

unset variable

echo "${variable-2}"    # 2
echo "${variable:-3}"   # 3

exit 0

The _default parameter_ construct finds use in providing "missing" command-line arguments in scripts.

DEFAULT\_FILENAME=generic.data
filename=${1:-$DEFAULT\_FILENAME}
#  If not otherwise specified, the following command block operates
#+ on the file "generic.data".
#  Begin-Command-Block
#  ...
#  ...
#  ...
#  End-Command-Block



#  From "hanoi2.bash" example:
DISKS=${1:-E\_NOPARAM}   # Must specify how many disks.
#  Set $DISKS to $1 command-line-parameter,
#+ or to $E\_NOPARAM if that is unset.

See also [Example 3-4](#EX58), [Example 31-2](#EX73), and [Example A-6](#COLLATZ).

Compare this method with [using an _and list_ to supply a default command-line argument](#ANDDEFAULT).

**${parameter=default}**, **${parameter:=default}**

If parameter not set, set it to _default_.

Both forms nearly equivalent. The : makes a difference only when $parameter has been declared and is null, [\[51\]](#FTN.AEN6310) as above.

echo ${var=abc}   # abc
echo ${var=xyz}   # abc
# $var had already been set to abc, so it did not change.

**${parameter+alt\_value}**, **${parameter:+alt\_value}**

If parameter set, use **alt\_value**, else use null string.

Both forms nearly equivalent. The : makes a difference only when _parameter_ has been declared and is null, see below.

echo "###### \\${parameter+alt\_value} ########"
echo

a=${param1+xyz}
echo "a = $a"      # a =

param2=
a=${param2+xyz}
echo "a = $a"      # a = xyz

param3=123
a=${param3+xyz}
echo "a = $a"      # a = xyz

echo
echo "###### \\${parameter:+alt\_value} ########"
echo

a=${param4:+xyz}
echo "a = $a"      # a =

param5=
a=${param5:+xyz}
echo "a = $a"      # a =
# Different result from   a=${param5+xyz}

param6=123
a=${param6:+xyz}
echo "a = $a"      # a = xyz

**${parameter?err\_msg}**, **${parameter:?err\_msg}**

If parameter set, use it, else print _err\_msg_ and _abort the script_ with an [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) of 1.

Both forms nearly equivalent. The : makes a difference only when _parameter_ has been declared and is null, as above.

**Example 10-7. Using parameter substitution and error messages**

#!/bin/bash

#  Check some of the system's environmental variables.
#  This is good preventative maintenance.
#  If, for example, $USER, the name of the person at the console, is not set,
#+ the machine will not recognize you.

: ${HOSTNAME?} ${USER?} ${HOME?} ${MAIL?}
  echo
  echo "Name of the machine is $HOSTNAME."
  echo "You are $USER."
  echo "Your home directory is $HOME."
  echo "Your mail INBOX is located in $MAIL."
  echo
  echo "If you are reading this message,"
  echo "critical environmental variables have been set."
  echo
  echo

# ------------------------------------------------------

#  The ${variablename?} construction can also check
#+ for variables set within the script.

ThisVariable=Value-of-ThisVariable
#  Note, by the way, that string variables may be set
#+ to characters disallowed in their names.
: ${ThisVariable?}
echo "Value of ThisVariable is $ThisVariable".

echo; echo


: ${ZZXy23AB?"ZZXy23AB has not been set."}
#  Since ZZXy23AB has not been set,
#+ then the script terminates with an error message.

# You can specify the error message.
# : ${variablename?"ERROR MESSAGE"}


# Same result with:   dummy\_variable=${ZZXy23AB?}
#                     dummy\_variable=${ZZXy23AB?"ZXy23AB has not been set."}
#
#                     echo ${ZZXy23AB?} >/dev/null

#  Compare these methods of checking whether a variable has been set
#+ with "set -u" . . .



echo "You will not see this message, because script already terminated."

HERE=0
exit $HERE   # Will NOT exit here.

# In fact, this script will return an exit status (echo $?) of 1.

**Example 10-8. Parameter substitution and "usage" messages**

#!/bin/bash
# usage-message.sh

: ${1?"Usage: $0 ARGUMENT"}
#  Script exits here if command-line parameter absent,
#+ with following error message.
#    usage-message.sh: 1: Usage: usage-message.sh ARGUMENT

echo "These two lines echo only if command-line parameter given."
echo "command-line parameter = \\"$1\\""

exit 0  # Will exit here only if command-line parameter present.

# Check the exit status, both with and without command-line parameter.
# If command-line parameter present, then "$?" is 0.
# If not, then "$?" is 1.

**Parameter substitution and/or expansion.** The following expressions are the complement to the **match** _in_ **expr** string operations (see [Example 16-9](#EX45)). These particular ones are used mostly in parsing file path names.

**Variable length / Substring removal**

**${#var}**

**String length** (number of characters in $var). For an [array](#ARRAYREF), **${#array}** is the length of the first element in the array.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Exceptions:

*   **${#\*}** and **${#@}** give the _number of positional parameters_.
    
*   For an array, **${#array\[\*\]}** and **${#array\[@\]}** give the number of elements in the array.
    

**Example 10-9. Length of a variable**

#!/bin/bash
# length.sh

E\_NO\_ARGS=65

if \[ $# -eq 0 \]  # Must have command-line args to demo script.
then
  echo "Please invoke this script with one or more command-line arguments."
  exit $E\_NO\_ARGS
fi  

var01=abcdEFGH28ij
echo "var01 = ${var01}"
echo "Length of var01 = ${#var01}"
# Now, let's try embedding a space.

**${var#Pattern}**, **${var##Pattern}**

**${var#Pattern}** Remove from $var the _shortest_ part of $Pattern that matches the _front end_ of $var.

**${var##Pattern}** Remove from $var the _longest_ part of $Pattern that matches the _front end_ of $var.

A usage illustration from [Example A-7](#DAYSBETWEEN):

\# Function from "days-between.sh" example.
# Strips leading zero(s) from argument passed.

strip\_leading\_zero () #  Strip possible leading zero(s)
{                     #+ from argument passed.
  return=${1#0}       #  The "1" refers to "$1" -- passed arg.
}                     #  The "0" is what to remove from "$1" -- strips zeros.

Manfred Schwarb's more elaborate variation of the above:

strip\_leading\_zero2 () # Strip possible leading zero(s), since otherwise
{                      # Bash will interpret such numbers as octal values.
  shopt -s extglob     # Turn on extended globbing.
  local val=${1##+(0)} # Use local variable, longest matching series of 0's.
  shopt -u extglob     # Turn off extended globbing.
  \_strip\_leading\_zero2=${val:-0}
                       # If input was 0, return 0 instead of "".
}

Another usage illustration:

echo \`basename $PWD\`        # Basename of current working directory.
echo "${PWD##\*/}"           # Basename of current working directory.
echo
echo \`basename $0\`          # Name of script.
echo $0                     # Name of script.
echo "${0##\*/}"             # Name of script.
echo
filename=test.data
echo "${filename##\*.}"      # data
                            # Extension of filename.

**${var%Pattern}**, **${var%%Pattern}**

**${var%Pattern}** Remove from $var the _shortest_ part of $Pattern that matches the _back end_ of $var.

**${var%%Pattern}** Remove from $var the _longest_ part of $Pattern that matches the _back end_ of $var.

[Version 2](#BASH2REF) of Bash added additional options.

**Variable expansion / Substring replacement**

These constructs have been adopted from _ksh_.

**${var:pos}**

Variable _var_ expanded, starting from offset _pos_.

**${var:pos:len}**

Expansion to a max of _len_ characters of variable _var_, from offset _pos_. See [Example A-13](#PW) for an example of the creative use of this operator.

**${var/Pattern/Replacement}**

First match of _Pattern_, within _var_ replaced with _Replacement_.

If _Replacement_ is omitted, then the first match of _Pattern_ is replaced by _nothing_, that is, deleted.

**${var//Pattern/Replacement}**

**Global replacement.** All matches of _Pattern_, within _var_ replaced with _Replacement_.

As above, if _Replacement_ is omitted, then all occurrences of _Pattern_ are replaced by _nothing_, that is, deleted.

**Example 10-12. Using pattern matching to parse arbitrary strings**

#!/bin/bash

var1=abcd-1234-defg
echo "var1 = $var1"

t=${var1#\*-\*}
echo "var1 (with everything, up to and including first - stripped out) = $t"
#  t=${var1#\*-}  works just the same,
#+ since # matches the shortest string,
#+ and \* matches everything preceding, including an empty string.
# (Thanks, Stephane Chazelas, for pointing this out.)

t=${var1##\*-\*}
echo "If var1 contains a \\"-\\", returns empty string...   var1 = $t"


t=${var1%\*-\*}
echo "var1 (with everything from the last - on stripped out) = $t"

echo

# -------------------------------------------
path\_name=/home/bozo/ideas/thoughts.for.today
# -------------------------------------------
echo "path\_name = $path\_name"
t=${path\_name##/\*/}
echo "path\_name, stripped of prefixes = $t"
# Same effect as   t=\`basename $path\_name\` in this particular case.
#  t=${path\_name%/}; t=${t##\*/}   is a more general solution,
#+ but still fails sometimes.
#  If $path\_name ends with a newline, then \`basename $path\_name\` will not work,
#+ but the above expression will.
# (Thanks, S.C.)

t=${path\_name%/\*.\*}
# Same effect as   t=\`dirname $path\_name\`
echo "path\_name, stripped of suffixes = $t"
# These will fail in some cases, such as "../", "/foo////", # "foo/", "/".
#  Removing suffixes, especially when the basename has no suffix,
#+ but the dirname does, also complicates matters.
# (Thanks, S.C.)

echo

t=${path\_name:11}
echo "$path\_name, with first 11 chars stripped off = $t"
t=${path\_name:11:5}
echo "$path\_name, with first 11 chars stripped off, length 5 = $t"

echo "$path\_name with all o's capitalized = $t"
t=${path\_name//o/}
echo "$path\_name with all o's deleted = $t"

exit 0

**${var/#Pattern/Replacement}**

If _prefix_ of _var_ matches _Pattern_, then substitute _Replacement_ for _Pattern_.

**${var/%Pattern/Replacement}**

If _suffix_ of _var_ matches _Pattern_, then substitute _Replacement_ for _Pattern_.

**Example 10-13. Matching patterns at prefix or suffix of string**

#!/bin/bash
# var-match.sh:
# Demo of pattern replacement at prefix / suffix of string.

Chapter 11. Loops and Branches
==============================

Â 

_

_What needs this iteration, woman?_

_\--Shakespeare, _Othello__

_

Operations on code blocks are the key to structured and organized shell scripts. Looping and branching constructs provide the tools for accomplishing this.

* * *

11.1. Loops
===========

A _loop_ is a block of code that _iterates_ [\[52\]](#FTN.AEN6560) a list of commands as long as the _loop control condition_ is true.

**for loops**

**for _arg_ in _\[list\]_**

This is the basic looping construct. It differs significantly from its _C_ counterpart.

**for** _arg_ in \[_list_\]  
do  
Â _command(s)_...  
done

![Note](../images/note.gif)

During each pass through the loop, _arg_ takes on the value of each successive variable in the _list_.

for arg in "$var1" "$var2" "$var3" ... "$varN"  
# In pass 1 of the loop, arg = $var1	    
# In pass 2 of the loop, arg = $var2	    
# In pass 3 of the loop, arg = $var3	    
# ...
# In pass N of the loop, arg = $varN

# Arguments in \[list\] quoted to prevent possible word splitting.

The argument _list_ may contain [wild cards](#ASTERISKREF).

If _do_ is on same line as _for_, there needs to be a semicolon after list.

**for** _arg_ in \[_list_\] ; do  

**Example 11-1. Simple _for_ loops**

#!/bin/bash
# Listing the planets.

for planet in Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto
do
  echo $planet  # Each planet on a separate line.
done

echo; echo

for planet in "Mercury Venus Earth Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune Pluto"
    # All planets on same line.
    # Entire 'list' enclosed in quotes creates a single variable.
    # Why? Whitespace incorporated into the variable.
do
  echo $planet
done

echo; echo "Whoops! Pluto is no longer a planet!"

exit 0

Each **\[list\]** element may contain multiple parameters. This is useful when processing parameters in groups. In such cases, use the [set](#SETREF) command (see [Example 15-16](#EX34)) to force parsing of each **\[list\]** element and assignment of each component to the positional parameters.

**Example 11-2. _for_ loop with two parameters in each \[list\] element**

#!/bin/bash
# Planets revisited.

# Associate the name of each planet with its distance from the sun.

for planet in "Mercury 36" "Venus 67" "Earth 93"  "Mars 142" "Jupiter 483"
do
  set -- $planet  #  Parses variable "planet"
                  #+ and sets positional parameters.
  #  The "--" prevents nasty surprises if $planet is null or
  #+ begins with a dash.

  #  May need to save original positional parameters,
  #+ since they get overwritten.
  #  One way of doing this is to use an array,
  #         original\_params=("$@")

  echo "$1		$2,000,000 miles from the sun"
  #-------two  tabs---concatenate zeroes onto parameter $2
done

# (Thanks, S.C., for additional clarification.)

exit 0

A variable may supply the **\[list\]** in a _for loop_.

**Example 11-3. _Fileinfo:_ operating on a file list contained in a variable**

#!/bin/bash
# fileinfo.sh

FILES="/usr/sbin/accept
/usr/sbin/pwck
/usr/sbin/chroot
/usr/bin/fakefile
/sbin/badblocks
/sbin/ypbind"     # List of files you are curious about.
                  # Threw in a dummy file, /usr/bin/fakefile.

echo

for file in $FILES
do

  if \[ ! -e "$file" \]       # Check if file exists.
  then
    echo "$file does not exist."; echo
    continue                # On to next.
   fi

  ls -l $file | awk '{ print $8 "         file size: " $5 }'  # Print 2 fields.
  whatis \`basename $file\`   # File info.
  # Note that the whatis database needs to have been set up for this to work.
  # To do this, as root run /usr/bin/makewhatis.
  echo
done  

exit 0

The **\[list\]** in a _for loop_ may be parameterized.

**Example 11-4. Operating on a parameterized file list**

#!/bin/bash

filename="\*txt"

for file in $filename
do
 echo "Contents of $file"
 echo "---"
 cat "$file"
 echo
done

If the **\[list\]** in a _for loop_ contains wild cards (\* and ?) used in filename expansion, then [globbing](#GLOBBINGREF) takes place.

**Example 11-5. Operating on files with a _for_ loop**

#!/bin/bash
# list-glob.sh: Generating \[list\] in a for-loop, using "globbing" ...
# Globbing = filename expansion.

echo

for file in \*
#           ^  Bash performs filename expansion
#+             on expressions that globbing recognizes.
do
  ls -l "$file"  # Lists all files in $PWD (current directory).
  #  Recall that the wild card character "\*" matches every filename,
  #+ however, in "globbing," it doesn't match dot-files.

  #  If the pattern matches no file, it is expanded to itself.
  #  To prevent this, set the nullglob option
  #+   (shopt -s nullglob).
  #  Thanks, S.C.
done

echo; echo

for file in \[jx\]\*
do
  rm -f $file    # Removes only files beginning with "j" or "x" in $PWD.
  echo "Removed file \\"$file\\"".
done

echo

exit 0

Omitting the **in \[list\]** part of a _for loop_ causes the loop to operate on $@ -- the [positional parameters](#POSPARAMREF). A particularly clever illustration of this is [Example A-15](#PRIMES). See also [Example 15-17](#REVPOSPARAMS).

**Example 11-6. Missing **in \[list\]** in a _for_ loop**

#!/bin/bash

#  Invoke this script both with and without arguments,
#+ and see what happens.

for a
do
 echo -n "$a "
done

#  The 'in list' missing, therefore the loop operates on '$@'
#+ (command-line argument list, including whitespace).

echo

exit 0

It is possible to use [command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF) to generate the **\[list\]** in a _for loop_. See also [Example 16-54](#EX53), [Example 11-11](#SYMLINKS) and [Example 16-48](#BASE).

**Example 11-7. Generating the **\[list\]** in a _for_ loop with command substitution**

#!/bin/bash
#  for-loopcmd.sh: for-loop with \[list\]
#+ generated by command substitution.

NUMBERS="9 7 3 8 37.53"

for number in \`echo $NUMBERS\`  # for number in 9 7 3 8 37.53
do
  echo -n "$number "
done

echo 
exit 0

Here is a somewhat more complex example of using command substitution to create the **\[list\]**.

**Example 11-8. A _grep_ replacement for binary files**

#!/bin/bash
# bin-grep.sh: Locates matching strings in a binary file.

# A "grep" replacement for binary files.
# Similar effect to "grep -a"

E\_BADARGS=65
E\_NOFILE=66

if \[ $# -ne 2 \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` search\_string filename"
  exit $E\_BADARGS
fi

if \[ ! -f "$2" \]
then
  echo "File \\"$2\\" does not exist."
  exit $E\_NOFILE
fi  


IFS=$'\\012'       # Per suggestion of Anton Filippov.
                  # was:  IFS="\\n"
for word in $( strings "$2" | grep "$1" )
# The "strings" command lists strings in binary files.
# Output then piped to "grep", which tests for desired string.
do
  echo $word
done

# As S.C. points out, lines 23 - 30 could be replaced with the simpler
#    strings "$2" | grep "$1" | tr -s "$IFS" '\[\\n\*\]'


#  Try something like  "./bin-grep.sh mem /bin/ls"
#+ to exercise this script.

exit 0

More of the same.

**Example 11-9. Listing all users on the system**

#!/bin/bash
# userlist.sh

PASSWORD\_FILE=/etc/passwd
n=1           # User number

for name in $(awk 'BEGIN{FS=":"}{print $1}' < "$PASSWORD\_FILE" )
# Field separator = :    ^^^^^^
# Print first field              ^^^^^^^^
# Get input from password file  /etc/passwd  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
do
  echo "USER #$n = $name"
  let "n += 1"
done  


# USER #1 = root
# USER #2 = bin
# USER #3 = daemon
# ...
# USER #33 = bozo

exit $?

#  Discussion:
#  ----------
#  How is it that an ordinary user, or a script run by same,
#+ can read /etc/passwd? (Hint: Check the /etc/passwd file permissions.)
#  Is this a security hole? Why or why not?

Yet another example of the **\[list\]** resulting from command substitution.

**Example 11-10. Checking all the binaries in a directory for authorship**

#!/bin/bash
# findstring.sh:
# Find a particular string in the binaries in a specified directory.

directory=/usr/bin/
fstring="Free Software Foundation"  # See which files come from the FSF.

for file in $( find $directory -type f -name '\*' | sort )
do
  strings -f $file | grep "$fstring" | sed -e "s%$directory%%"
  #  In the "sed" expression,
  #+ it is necessary to substitute for the normal "/" delimiter
  #+ because "/" happens to be one of the characters filtered out.
  #  Failure to do so gives an error message. (Try it.)
done  

exit $?

#  Exercise (easy):
#  ---------------
#  Convert this script to take command-line parameters
#+ for $directory and $fstring.

A final example of **\[list\]** / command substitution, but this time the "command" is a [function](#FUNCTIONREF).

generate\_list ()
{
  echo "one two three"
}

for word in $(generate\_list)  # Let "word" grab output of function.
do
  echo "$word"
done

# one
# two
# three

The output of a _for loop_ may be piped to a command or commands.

**Example 11-11. Listing the _symbolic links_ in a directory**

#!/bin/bash
# symlinks.sh: Lists symbolic links in a directory.


directory=${1-\`pwd\`}
#  Defaults to current working directory,
#+ if not otherwise specified.
#  Equivalent to code block below.
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# ARGS=1                 # Expect one command-line argument.
#
# if \[ $# -ne "$ARGS" \]  # If not 1 arg...
# then
#   directory=\`pwd\`      # current working directory
# else
#   directory=$1
# fi
# ----------------------------------------------------------

echo "symbolic links in directory \\"$directory\\""

for file in "$( find $directory -type l )"   # -type l = symbolic links
do
  echo "$file"
done | sort                                  # Otherwise file list is unsorted.
#  Strictly speaking, a loop isn't really necessary here,
#+ since the output of the "find" command is expanded into a single word.
#  However, it's easy to understand and illustrative this way.

#  As Dominik 'Aeneas' Schnitzer points out,
#+ failing to quote  $( find $directory -type l )
#+ will choke on filenames with embedded whitespace.
#  containing whitespace. 

exit 0


# --------------------------------------------------------
# Jean Helou proposes the following alternative:

echo "symbolic links in directory \\"$directory\\""
# Backup of the current IFS. One can never be too cautious.
OLDIFS=$IFS
IFS=:

for file in $(find $directory -type l -printf "%p$IFS")
do     #                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
       echo "$file"
       done|sort

# And, James "Mike" Conley suggests modifying Helou's code thusly:

OLDIFS=$IFS
IFS='' # Null IFS means no word breaks
for file in $( find $directory -type l )
do
  echo $file
  done | sort

#  This works in the "pathological" case of a directory name having
#+ an embedded colon.
#  "This also fixes the pathological case of the directory name having
#+  a colon (or space in earlier example) as well."

The stdout of a loop may be [redirected](#IOREDIRREF) to a file, as this slight modification to the previous example shows.

**Example 11-12. Symbolic links in a directory, saved to a file**

#!/bin/bash
# symlinks.sh: Lists symbolic links in a directory.

OUTFILE=symlinks.list                         # save-file

directory=${1-\`pwd\`}
#  Defaults to current working directory,
#+ if not otherwise specified.


echo "symbolic links in directory \\"$directory\\"" > "$OUTFILE"
echo "---------------------------" >> "$OUTFILE"

for file in "$( find $directory -type l )"    # -type l = symbolic links
do
  echo "$file"
done | sort >> "$OUTFILE"                     # stdout of loop
#           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^                       redirected to save file.

# echo "Output file = $OUTFILE"

exit $?

There is an alternative syntax to a _for loop_ that will look very familiar to C programmers. This requires [double parentheses](#DBLPARENSREF).

**Example 11-13. A C-style _for_ loop**

#!/bin/bash
# Multiple ways to count up to 10.

echo

# Standard syntax.
for a in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
do
  echo -n "$a "
done  

echo; echo

# +==========================================+

# Using "seq" ...
for a in \`seq 10\`
do
  echo -n "$a "
done  

echo; echo

# +==========================================+

Now, a _for loop_ used in a "real-life" context.

**Example 11-14. Using _efax_ in batch mode**

#!/bin/bash
# Faxing (must have 'efax' package installed).

EXPECTED\_ARGS=2
E\_BADARGS=85
MODEM\_PORT="/dev/ttyS2"   # May be different on your machine.
#                ^^^^^      PCMCIA modem card default port.

if \[ $# -ne $EXPECTED\_ARGS \]
# Check for proper number of command-line args.
then
   echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` phone# text-file"
   exit $E\_BADARGS
fi


if \[ ! -f "$2" \]
then
  echo "File $2 is not a text file."
  #     File is not a regular file, or does not exist.
  exit $E\_BADARGS
fi
  

fax make $2              #  Create fax-formatted files from text files.

for file in $(ls $2.0\*)  #  Concatenate the converted files.
                         #  Uses wild card (filename "globbing")
			 #+ in variable list.
do
  fil="$fil $file"
done  

efax -d "$MODEM\_PORT"  -t "T$1" $fil   # Finally, do the work.
# Trying adding  -o1  if above line fails.


#  As S.C. points out, the for-loop can be eliminated with
#     efax -d /dev/ttyS2 -o1 -t "T$1" $2.0\*
#+ but it's not quite as instructive \[grin\].

exit $?   # Also, efax sends diagnostic messages to stdout.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The [keywords](#KEYWORDREF) **do** and **done** delineate the _for-loop_ command block. However, these may, in certain contexts, be omitted by framing the command block within [curly brackets](#CODEBLOCKREF)

for((n=1; n<=10; n++)) 
# No do!
{
  echo -n "\* $n \*"
}
# No done!


# Outputs:
# \* 1 \*\* 2 \*\* 3 \*\* 4 \*\* 5 \*\* 6 \*\* 7 \*\* 8 \*\* 9 \*\* 10 \*
# And, echo $? returns 0, so Bash does not register an error.


echo


#  But, note that in a classic for-loop:    for n in \[list\] ...
#+ a terminal semicolon is required.

for n in 1 2 3
{  echo -n "$n "; }
#               ^


# Thank you, YongYe, for pointing this out.

**while**

This construct tests for a condition at the top of a loop, and keeps looping as long as that condition is true (returns a 0 [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF)). In contrast to a [for loop](#FORLOOPREF1), a _while loop_ finds use in situations where the number of loop repetitions is not known beforehand.

**while** \[ _condition_ \]  
do  
Â _command(s)_...  
done

The bracket construct in a _while loop_ is nothing more than our old friend, the [test brackets](#TESTCONSTRUCTS1) used in an _if/then_ test. In fact, a _while loop_ can legally use the more versatile [double-brackets construct](#DBLBRACKETS) (while \[\[ condition \]\]).

[As is the case with _for loops_](#NEEDSEMICOLON), placing the _do_ on the same line as the condition test requires a semicolon.

**while** \[ _condition_ \] ; do

Note that the _test brackets_ [are _not_ mandatory](#WHILENOBRACKETS) in a _while_ loop. See, for example, the [getopts construct](#GETOPTSX).

**Example 11-15. Simple _while_ loop**

#!/bin/bash

var0=0
LIMIT=10

while \[ "$var0" -lt "$LIMIT" \]
#      ^                    ^
# Spaces, because these are "test-brackets" . . .
do
  echo -n "$var0 "        # -n suppresses newline.
  #             ^           Space, to separate printed out numbers.

  var0=\`expr $var0 + 1\`   # var0=$(($var0+1))  also works.
                          # var0=$((var0 + 1)) also works.
                          # let "var0 += 1"    also works.
done                      # Various other methods also work.

echo

exit 0

**Example 11-16. Another _while_ loop**

#!/bin/bash

echo
                               # Equivalent to:
while \[ "$var1" != "end" \]     # while test "$var1" != "end"
do
  echo "Input variable #1 (end to exit) "
  read var1                    # Not 'read $var1' (why?).
  echo "variable #1 = $var1"   # Need quotes because of "#" . . .
  # If input is 'end', echoes it here.
  # Does not test for termination condition until top of loop.
  echo
done  

exit 0

A _while loop_ may have multiple conditions. Only the final condition determines when the loop terminates. This necessitates a slightly different loop syntax, however.

**Example 11-17. _while_ loop with multiple conditions**

#!/bin/bash

var1=unset
previous=$var1

while echo "previous-variable = $previous"
      echo
      previous=$var1
      \[ "$var1" != end \] # Keeps track of what $var1 was previously.
      # Four conditions on \*while\*, but only the final one controls loop.
      # The \*last\* exit status is the one that counts.
do
echo "Input variable #1 (end to exit) "
  read var1
  echo "variable #1 = $var1"
done  

# Try to figure out how this all works.
# It's a wee bit tricky.

exit 0

As with a _for loop_, a _while loop_ may employ C-style syntax by using the double-parentheses construct (see also [Example 8-5](#CVARS)).

**Example 11-18. C-style syntax in a _while_ loop**

#!/bin/bash
# wh-loopc.sh: Count to 10 in a "while" loop.

LIMIT=10                 # 10 iterations.
a=1

while \[ "$a" -le $LIMIT \]
do
  echo -n "$a "
  let "a+=1"
done                     # No surprises, so far.

echo; echo

# +=================================================================+

# Now, we'll repeat with C-like syntax.

((a = 1))      # a=1
# Double parentheses permit space when setting a variable, as in C.

while (( a <= LIMIT ))   #  Double parentheses,
do                       #+ and no "$" preceding variables.
  echo -n "$a "
  ((a += 1))             # let "a+=1"
  # Yes, indeed.
  # Double parentheses permit incrementing a variable with C-like syntax.
done

echo

# C and Java programmers can feel right at home in Bash.

exit 0

Inside its test brackets, a _while loop_ can call a [function](#FUNCTIONREF).

t=0

condition ()
{
  ((t++))

  if \[ $t -lt 5 \]
  then
    return 0  # true
  else
    return 1  # false
  fi
}

while condition
#     ^^^^^^^^^
#     Function call -- four loop iterations.
do
  echo "Still going: t = $t"
done

# Still going: t = 1
# Still going: t = 2
# Still going: t = 3
# Still going: t = 4

Similar to the [if-test](#IFGREPREF) construct, a _while_ loop can omit the test brackets.

while condition
do
   command(s) ...
done

By coupling the power of the [read](#READREF) command with a _while loop_, we get the handy [while read](#WHILEREADREF) construct, useful for reading and parsing files.

cat $filename |   # Supply input from a file.
while read line   # As long as there is another line to read ...
do
  ...
done

# =========== Snippet from "sd.sh" example script ========== #

  while read value   # Read one data point at a time.
  do
    rt=$(echo "scale=$SC; $rt + $value" | bc)
    (( ct++ ))
  done

  am=$(echo "scale=$SC; $rt / $ct" | bc)

  echo $am; return $ct   # This function "returns" TWO values!
  #  Caution: This little trick will not work if $ct > 255!
  #  To handle a larger number of data points,
  #+ simply comment out the "return $ct" above.
} <"$datafile"   # Feed in data file.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

A _while loop_ may have its stdin [redirected to a file](#REDIRREF) by a < at its end.

A _while loop_ may have its stdin [supplied by a pipe](#READPIPEREF).

**until**

This construct tests for a condition at the top of a loop, and keeps looping as long as that condition is _false_ (opposite of _while loop_).

**until** \[ _condition-is-true_ \]  
do  
Â _command(s)_...  
done

Note that an _until loop_ tests for the terminating condition at the _top_ of the loop, differing from a similar construct in some programming languages.

As is the case with _for loops_, placing the _do_ on the same line as the condition test requires a semicolon.

**until** \[ _condition-is-true_ \] ; do

**Example 11-19. _until_ loop**

#!/bin/bash

END\_CONDITION=end

until \[ "$var1" = "$END\_CONDITION" \]
# Tests condition here, at top of loop.
do
  echo "Input variable #1 "
  echo "($END\_CONDITION to exit)"
  read var1
  echo "variable #1 = $var1"
  echo
done  

#                     ---                        #

#  As with "for" and "while" loops,
#+ an "until" loop permits C-like test constructs.

LIMIT=10
var=0

until (( var > LIMIT ))
do  # ^^ ^     ^     ^^   No brackets, no $ prefixing variables.
  echo -n "$var "
  (( var++ ))
done    # 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 


exit 0

How to choose between a _for_ loop or a _while_ loop or _until_ loop? In **C**, you would typically use a _for_ loop when the number of loop iterations is known beforehand. With _Bash_, however, the situation is fuzzier. The Bash _for_ loop is more loosely structured and more flexible than its equivalent in other languages. Therefore, feel free to use whatever type of loop gets the job done in the simplest way.

* * *

11.2. Nested Loops
==================

A _nested loop_ is a loop within a loop, an inner loop within the body of an outer one. How this works is that the first pass of the outer loop triggers the inner loop, which executes to completion. Then the second pass of the outer loop triggers the inner loop again. This repeats until the outer loop finishes. Of course, a _break_ within either the inner or outer loop would interrupt this process.

**Example 11-20. Nested Loop**

#!/bin/bash
# nested-loop.sh: Nested "for" loops.

outer=1             # Set outer loop counter.

# Beginning of outer loop.
for a in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  echo "Pass $outer in outer loop."
  echo "---------------------"
  inner=1           # Reset inner loop counter.

  # ===============================================
  # Beginning of inner loop.
  for b in 1 2 3 4 5
  do
    echo "Pass $inner in inner loop."
    let "inner+=1"  # Increment inner loop counter.
  done
  # End of inner loop.
  # ===============================================

  let "outer+=1"    # Increment outer loop counter. 
  echo              # Space between output blocks in pass of outer loop.
done               
# End of outer loop.

exit 0

See [Example 27-11](#BUBBLE) for an illustration of nested [while loops](#WHILELOOPREF), and [Example 27-13](#EX68) to see a while loop nested inside an [until loop](#UNTILLOOPREF).

11.3. Loop Control
==================

Â 

_

_Tournez cent tours, tournez mille tours,_

_Tournez souvent et tournez toujours . . ._

_\--Verlaine, "Chevaux de bois"_

_

**Commands affecting loop behavior**

**break**, **continue**

The **break** and **continue** loop control commands [\[53\]](#FTN.AEN6981) correspond exactly to their counterparts in other programming languages. The **break** command terminates the loop (_breaks_ out of it), while **continue** causes a jump to the next [iteration](#ITERATIONREF) of the loop, skipping all the remaining commands in that particular loop cycle.

**Example 11-21. Effects of _break_ and **continue** in a loop**

#!/bin/bash

LIMIT=19  # Upper limit

echo
echo "Printing Numbers 1 through 20 (but not 3 and 11)."

a=0

while \[ $a -le "$LIMIT" \]
do
 a=$(($a+1))

 if \[ "$a" -eq 3 \] || \[ "$a" -eq 11 \]  # Excludes 3 and 11.
 then
   continue      # Skip rest of this particular loop iteration.
 fi

 echo -n "$a "   # This will not execute for 3 and 11.
done 

# Exercise:
# Why does the loop print up to 20?

echo; echo

echo Printing Numbers 1 through 20, but something happens after 2.

##################################################################

# Same loop, but substituting 'break' for 'continue'.

a=0

while \[ "$a" -le "$LIMIT" \]
do
 a=$(($a+1))

 if \[ "$a" -gt 2 \]
 then
   break  # Skip entire rest of loop.
 fi

 echo -n "$a "
done

echo; echo; echo

exit 0

The **break** command may optionally take a parameter. A plain **break** terminates only the innermost loop in which it is embedded, but a **break N** breaks out of _N_ levels of loop.

**Example 11-22. Breaking out of multiple loop levels**

#!/bin/bash
# break-levels.sh: Breaking out of loops.

# "break N" breaks out of N level loops.

for outerloop in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  echo -n "Group $outerloop:   "

  # --------------------------------------------------------
  for innerloop in 1 2 3 4 5
  do
    echo -n "$innerloop "

    if \[ "$innerloop" -eq 3 \]
    then
      break  # Try   break 2   to see what happens.
             # ("Breaks" out of both inner and outer loops.)
    fi
  done
  # --------------------------------------------------------

  echo
done  

echo

exit 0

The **continue** command, similar to **break**, optionally takes a parameter. A plain **continue** cuts short the current iteration within its loop and begins the next. A **continue N** terminates all remaining iterations at its loop level and continues with the next iteration at the loop, N levels above.

**Example 11-23. Continuing at a higher loop level**

#!/bin/bash
# The "continue N" command, continuing at the Nth level loop.

for outer in I II III IV V           # outer loop
do
  echo; echo -n "Group $outer: "

  # --------------------------------------------------------------------
  for inner in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  # inner loop
  do

    if \[\[ "$inner" -eq 7 && "$outer" = "III" \]\]
    then
      continue 2  # Continue at loop on 2nd level, that is "outer loop".
                  # Replace above line with a simple "continue"
                  # to see normal loop behavior.
    fi  

    echo -n "$inner "  # 7 8 9 10 will not echo on "Group III."
  done  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------

done

echo; echo

# Exercise:
# Come up with a meaningful use for "continue N" in a script.

exit 0

**Example 11-24. Using _continue N_ in an actual task**

\# Albert Reiner gives an example of how to use "continue N":
# ---------------------------------------------------------

#  Suppose I have a large number of jobs that need to be run, with
#+ any data that is to be treated in files of a given name pattern
#+ in a directory. There are several machines that access
#+ this directory, and I want to distribute the work over these
#+ different boxen.
#  Then I usually nohup something like the following on every box:

while true
do
  for n in .iso.\*
  do
    \[ "$n" = ".iso.opts" \] && continue
    beta=${n#.iso.}
    \[ -r .Iso.$beta \] && continue
    \[ -r .lock.$beta \] && sleep 10 && continue
    lockfile -r0 .lock.$beta || continue
    echo -n "$beta: " \`date\`
    run-isotherm $beta
    date
    ls -alF .Iso.$beta
    \[ -r .Iso.$beta \] && rm -f .lock.$beta
    continue 2
  done
  break
done

exit 0

#  The details, in particular the sleep N, are particular to my
#+ application, but the general pattern is:

while true
do
  for job in {pattern}
  do
    {job already done or running} && continue
    {mark job as running, do job, mark job as done}
    continue 2
  done
  break        # Or something like \`sleep 600' to avoid termination.
done

#  This way the script will stop only when there are no more jobs to do
#+ (including jobs that were added during runtime). Through the use
#+ of appropriate lockfiles it can be run on several machines
#+ concurrently without duplication of calculations \[which run a couple
#+ of hours in my case, so I really want to avoid this\]. Also, as search
#+ always starts again from the beginning, one can encode priorities in
#+ the file names. Of course, one could also do this without \`continue 2',
#+ but then one would have to actually check whether or not some job
#+ was done (so that we should immediately look for the next job) or not
#+ (in which case we terminate or sleep for a long time before checking
#+ for a new job).

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

The **continue N** construct is difficult to understand and tricky to use in any meaningful context. It is probably best avoided.

* * *

11.4. Testing and Branching
===========================

The **case** and **select** constructs are technically not loops, since they do not iterate the execution of a code block. Like loops, however, they direct program flow according to conditions at the top or bottom of the block.

**Controlling program flow in a code block**

**case (in) / esac**

The **case** construct is the shell scripting analog to _switch_ in **C/C++**. It permits branching to one of a number of code blocks, depending on condition tests. It serves as a kind of shorthand for multiple if/then/else statements and is an appropriate tool for creating menus.

**case** "$_variable_" in  
  
Â "$_condition1_" )  
Â _command_...  
Â ;;  
  
Â "$_condition2_" )  
Â _command_...  
Â ;;  
  
  
**esac**

![Note](../images/note.gif)

*   Quoting the variables is not mandatory, since word splitting does not take place.
    
*   Each test line ends with a right paren **)**. [\[54\]](#FTN.AEN7087)
    
*   Each condition block ends with a _double_ semicolon ;;.
    
*   If a condition tests _true_, then the associated commands execute and the **case** block terminates.
    
*   The entire **case** block ends with an **esac** (_case_ spelled backwards).
    

**Example 11-25. Using _case_**

#!/bin/bash
# Testing ranges of characters.

echo; echo "Hit a key, then hit return."
read Keypress

case "$Keypress" in
  \[\[:lower:\]\]   ) echo "Lowercase letter";;
  \[\[:upper:\]\]   ) echo "Uppercase letter";;
  \[0-9\]         ) echo "Digit";;
  \*             ) echo "Punctuation, whitespace, or other";;
esac      #  Allows ranges of characters in \[square brackets\],
          #+ or POSIX ranges in \[\[double square brackets.

#  In the first version of this example,
#+ the tests for lowercase and uppercase characters were
#+ \[a-z\] and \[A-Z\].
#  This no longer works in certain locales and/or Linux distros.
#  POSIX is more portable.
#  Thanks to Frank Wang for pointing this out.

#  Exercise:
#  --------
#  As the script stands, it accepts a single keystroke, then terminates.
#  Change the script so it accepts repeated input,
#+ reports on each keystroke, and terminates only when "X" is hit.
#  Hint: enclose everything in a "while" loop.

exit 0

**Example 11-26. Creating menus using _case_**

#!/bin/bash

   echo

  ;;

esac

echo

#  Exercise:
#  --------
#  Change the script so it accepts multiple inputs,
#+ instead of terminating after displaying just one address.

exit 0

An exceptionally clever use of **case** involves testing for command-line parameters.

#! /bin/bash

case "$1" in
  "") echo "Usage: ${0##\*/} <filename>"; exit $E\_PARAM;;
                      # No command-line parameters,
                      # or first parameter empty.
# Note that ${0##\*/} is ${var##pattern} param substitution.
                      # Net result is $0.

  -\*) FILENAME=./$1;;   #  If filename passed as argument ($1)
                      #+ starts with a dash,
                      #+ replace it with ./$1
                      #+ so further commands don't interpret it
                      #+ as an option.

  \* ) FILENAME=$1;;     # Otherwise, $1.
esac

Here is a more straightforward example of command-line parameter handling:

#! /bin/bash


while \[ $# -gt 0 \]; do    # Until you run out of parameters . . .
  case "$1" in
    -d|--debug)
              # "-d" or "--debug" parameter?
              DEBUG=1
              ;;
    -c|--conf)
              CONFFILE="$2"
              shift
              if \[ ! -f $CONFFILE \]; then
                echo "Error: Supplied file doesn't exist!"
                exit $E\_CONFFILE     # File not found error.
              fi
              ;;
  esac
  shift       # Check next set of parameters.

**select**

The **select** construct, adopted from the Korn Shell, is yet another tool for building menus.

**select** _variable_ \[in _list_\]  
do  
Â _command_...  
Â break  
done

This prompts the user to enter one of the choices presented in the variable list. Note that **select** uses the $PS3 prompt (#? ) by default, but this may be changed.

**Example 11-30. Creating menus using _select_**

#!/bin/bash

PS3='Choose your favorite vegetable: ' # Sets the prompt string.
                                       # Otherwise it defaults to #? .

echo

select vegetable in "beans" "carrots" "potatoes" "onions" "rutabagas"
do
  echo
  echo "Your favorite veggie is $vegetable."
  echo "Yuck!"
  echo
  break  # What happens if there is no 'break' here?
done

exit

# Exercise:
# --------
#  Fix this script to accept user input not specified in
#+ the "select" statement.
#  For example, if the user inputs "peas,"
#+ the script would respond "Sorry. That is not on the menu."

If **in _list_** is omitted, then **select** uses the list of command line arguments ($@) passed to the script or the function containing the **select** construct.

Compare this to the behavior of a

**for** _variable_ \[in _list_\]

construct with the **in _list_** omitted.

**Example 11-31. Creating menus using _select_ in a function**

#!/bin/bash

PS3='Choose your favorite vegetable: '

echo

choice\_of()
{
select vegetable
# \[in list\] omitted, so 'select' uses arguments passed to function.
do
  echo
  echo "Your favorite veggie is $vegetable."
  echo "Yuck!"
  echo
  break
done
}

choice\_of beans rice carrots radishes rutabaga spinach
#         $1    $2   $3      $4       $5       $6

Chapter 12. Command Substitution
================================

**Command substitution** reassigns the output of a command [\[55\]](#FTN.AEN7205) or even multiple commands; it literally plugs the command output into another context. [\[56\]](#FTN.AEN7211)

The classic form of command substitution uses _backquotes_ (\`...\`). Commands within backquotes (backticks) generate command-line text.

script\_name=\`basename $0\`
echo "The name of this script is $script\_name."

**The output of commands can be used as arguments to another command, to set a variable, and even for generating the argument list in a [for](#FORLOOPREF1) loop.**

rm \`cat filename\`   # "filename" contains a list of files to delete.
#
# S. C. points out that "arg list too long" error might result.
# Better is              xargs rm -- < filename 
# ( -- covers those cases where "filename" begins with a "-" )

textfile\_listing=\`ls \*.txt\`
# Variable contains names of all \*.txt files in current working directory.
echo $textfile\_listing

textfile\_listing2=$(ls \*.txt)   # The alternative form of command substitution.
echo $textfile\_listing2
# Same result.

# A possible problem with putting a list of files into a single string
# is that a newline may creep in.
#
# A safer way to assign a list of files to a parameter is with an array.
#      shopt -s nullglob    # If no match, filename expands to nothing.
#      textfile\_listing=( \*.txt )
#
# Thanks, S.C.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Command substitution invokes a [subshell](#SUBSHELLSREF).

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Command substitution may result in [word splitting](#WSPLITREF).

COMMAND \`echo a b\`     # 2 args: a and b

COMMAND "\`echo a b\`"   # 1 arg: "a b"

COMMAND \`echo\`         # no arg

COMMAND "\`echo\`"       # one empty arg


# Thanks, S.C.

Even when there is no word splitting, command substitution can remove trailing newlines.

\# cd "\`pwd\`"  # This should always work.
# However...

mkdir 'dir with trailing newline
'

cd 'dir with trailing newline
'

cd "\`pwd\`"  # Error message:
# bash: cd: /tmp/file with trailing newline: No such file or directory

cd "$PWD"   # Works fine.





old\_tty\_setting=$(stty -g)   # Save old terminal setting.
echo "Hit a key "
stty -icanon -echo           # Disable "canonical" mode for terminal.
                             # Also, disable \*local\* echo.
key=$(dd bs=1 count=1 2> /dev/null)   # Using 'dd' to get a keypress.
stty "$old\_tty\_setting"      # Restore old setting. 
echo "You hit ${#key} key."  # ${#variable} = number of characters in $variable
#
# Hit any key except RETURN, and the output is "You hit 1 key."
# Hit RETURN, and it's "You hit 0 key."
# The newline gets eaten in the command substitution.

#Code snippet by StÃ©phane Chazelas.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Using **echo** to output an _unquoted_ variable set with command substitution removes trailing newlines characters from the output of the reassigned command(s). This can cause unpleasant surprises.

dir\_listing=\`ls -l\`
echo $dir\_listing     # unquoted

# Expecting a nicely ordered directory listing.

# However, what you get is:
# total 3 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 30 May 13 17:15 1.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo
# bozo 51 May 15 20:57 t2.sh -rwxr-xr-x 1 bozo bozo 217 Mar 5 21:13 wi.sh

# The newlines disappeared.


echo "$dir\_listing"   # quoted
# -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo       30 May 13 17:15 1.txt
# -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo       51 May 15 20:57 t2.sh
# -rwxr-xr-x    1 bozo      217 Mar  5 21:13 wi.sh

Command substitution even permits setting a variable to the contents of a file, using either [redirection](#IOREDIRREF) or the [cat](#CATREF) command.

variable1=\`<file1\`      #  Set "variable1" to contents of "file1".
variable2=\`cat file2\`   #  Set "variable2" to contents of "file2".
                        #  This, however, forks a new process,
                        #+ so the line of code executes slower than the above version.

#  Note that the variables may contain embedded whitespace,
#+ or even (horrors), control characters.

#  It is not necessary to explicitly assign a variable.
echo "\` <$0\`"           # Echoes the script itself to stdout.

\#  Excerpts from system file, /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
#+ (on a Red Hat Linux installation)


if \[ -f /fsckoptions \]; then
        fsckoptions=\`cat /fsckoptions\`
...
fi
#
#
if \[ -e "/proc/ide/${disk\[$device\]}/media" \] ; then
             hdmedia=\`cat /proc/ide/${disk\[$device\]}/media\`
...
fi
#
#
if \[ ! -n "\`uname -r | grep -- "-"\`" \]; then
       ktag="\`cat /proc/version\`"
...
fi
#
#
if \[ $usb = "1" \]; then
    sleep 5
    mouseoutput=\`cat /proc/bus/usb/devices 2>/dev/null|grep -E "^I.\*Cls=03.\*Prot=02"\`
    kbdoutput=\`cat /proc/bus/usb/devices 2>/dev/null|grep -E "^I.\*Cls=03.\*Prot=01"\`
...
fi

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Do not set a variable to the contents of a _long_ text file unless you have a very good reason for doing so. Do not set a variable to the contents of a _binary_ file, even as a joke.

**Example 12-1. Stupid script tricks**

#!/bin/bash
# stupid-script-tricks.sh: Don't try this at home, folks.
# From "Stupid Script Tricks," Volume I.

exit 99  ### Comment out this line if you dare.

dangerous\_variable=\`cat /boot/vmlinuz\`   # The compressed Linux kernel itself.

echo "string-length of \\$dangerous\_variable = ${#dangerous\_variable}"
# string-length of $dangerous\_variable = 794151
# (Newer kernels are bigger.)
# Does not give same count as 'wc -c /boot/vmlinuz'.

# echo "$dangerous\_variable"
# Don't try this! It would hang the script.


#  The document author is aware of no useful applications for
#+ setting a variable to the contents of a binary file.

exit 0

Notice that a _buffer overrun_ does not occur. This is one instance where an interpreted language, such as Bash, provides more protection from programmer mistakes than a compiled language.

Command substitution permits setting a variable to the output of a [loop](#FORLOOPREF1). The key to this is grabbing the output of an [echo](#ECHOREF) command within the loop.

**Example 12-2. Generating a variable from a loop**

#!/bin/bash
# csubloop.sh: Setting a variable to the output of a loop.

variable1=\`for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  echo -n "$i"                 #  The 'echo' command is critical
done\`                          #+ to command substitution here.

echo "variable1 = $variable1"  # variable1 = 12345


i=0
variable2=\`while \[ "$i" -lt 10 \]
do
  echo -n "$i"                 # Again, the necessary 'echo'.
  let "i += 1"                 # Increment.
done\`

echo "variable2 = $variable2"  # variable2 = 0123456789

#  Demonstrates that it's possible to embed a loop
#+ inside a variable declaration.

exit 0

Command substitution makes it possible to extend the toolset available to Bash. It is simply a matter of writing a program or script that outputs to stdout (like a well-behaved UNIX tool should) and assigning that output to a variable.

#include <stdio.h>

/\*  "Hello, world." C program  \*/		

int main()
{
  printf( "Hello, world.\\n" );
  return (0);
}

bash$ **gcc -o hello hello.c**
	      

#!/bin/bash
# hello.sh		

greeting=\`./hello\`
echo $greeting

bash$ **sh hello.sh**
Hello, world.
	        

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The **$(...)** form has superseded backticks for command substitution.

output=$(sed -n /"$1"/p $file)   # From "grp.sh"	example.
	      
# Setting a variable to the contents of a text file.
File\_contents1=$(cat $file1)      
File\_contents2=$(<$file2)        # Bash permits this also.

The **$(...)** form of command substitution treats a double backslash in a different way than **\`...\`**.

bash$ **echo \`echo \\\\\`**

bash$ **echo $(echo \\\\)**
\\
	      

The **$(...)** form of command substitution permits nesting. [\[57\]](#FTN.AEN7308)

word\_count=$( wc -w $(echo \* | awk '{print $8}') )

Or, for something a bit more elaborate . . .

# agram2.sh
# Example of nested command substitution.

#+ that is part of the author's "yawl" word list package.

E\_NOARGS=86

MINLEN=7

if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  echo "Usage $0 LETTERSET"
  exit $E\_NOARGS         # Script needs a command-line argument.
elif \[ ${#1} -lt $MINLEN \]
then
  echo "Argument must have at least $MINLEN letters."
  exit $E\_BADARG
fi



FILTER='.......'         # Must have at least 7 letters.
#       1234567
Anagrams=( $(echo $(anagram $1 | grep $FILTER) ) )
#          $(     $(  nested command sub.    ) )
#        (              array assignment         )

echo
echo "${#Anagrams\[\*\]}  7+ letter anagrams found"
echo
echo ${Anagrams\[0\]}      # First anagram.
echo ${Anagrams\[1\]}      # Second anagram.
                         # Etc.

Chapter 13. Arithmetic Expansion
================================

Arithmetic expansion provides a powerful tool for performing (integer) arithmetic operations in scripts. Translating a string into a numerical expression is relatively straightforward using _backticks_, _double parentheses_, or _let_.

**Variations**

Arithmetic expansion with [backticks](#BACKQUOTESREF) (often used in conjunction with [expr](#EXPRREF))

z=\`expr $z + 3\`          # The 'expr' command performs the expansion.

Arithmetic expansion with [double parentheses](#DBLPARENS), and using [let](#LETREF)

The use of _backticks_ (_backquotes_) in arithmetic expansion has been superseded by _double parentheses_ -- **((...))** and **$((...))** -- and also by the very convenient [let](#LETREF) construction.

z=$(($z+3))
z=$((z+3))                                  #  Also correct.
                                            #  Within double parentheses,
                                            #+ parameter dereferencing
                                            #+ is optional.

# $((EXPRESSION)) is arithmetic expansion.  #  Not to be confused with
                                            #+ command substitution.



# You may also use operations within double parentheses without assignment.

  n=0
  echo "n = $n"                             # n = 0

  (( n += 1 ))                              # Increment.
# (( $n += 1 )) is incorrect!
  echo "n = $n"                             # n = 1


let z=z+3
let "z += 3"  #  Quotes permit the use of spaces in variable assignment.
              #  The 'let' operator actually performs arithmetic evaluation,
              #+ rather than expansion.

Examples of arithmetic expansion in scripts:

2.  [Example 11-15](#EX25)
    
3.  [Example 27-1](#EX66)

Chapter 15. Internal Commands and Builtins
==========================================

A _builtin_ is a **command** contained within the Bash tool set, literally _built in_. This is either for performance reasons -- builtins execute faster than external commands, which usually require _forking off_ [\[58\]](#FTN.AEN8607) a separate process -- or because a particular builtin needs direct access to the shell internals.

When a command or the shell itself initiates (or _spawns_) a new subprocess to carry out a task, this is called _forking_. This new process is the _child_, and the process that _forked_ it off is the _parent_. While the _child process_ is doing its work, the _parent process_ is still executing.

Note that while a _parent process_ gets the _process ID_ of the _child process_, and can thus pass arguments to it, _the reverse is not true_. [This can create problems that are subtle and hard to track down.](#PARCHILDPROBREF)

**Example 15-1. A script that spawns multiple instances of itself**

#!/bin/bash
# spawn.sh


PIDS=$(pidof sh $0)  # Process IDs of the various instances of this script.
P\_array=( $PIDS )    # Put them in an array (why?).
echo $PIDS           # Show process IDs of parent and child processes.
let "instances = ${#P\_array\[\*\]} - 1"  # Count elements, less 1.
                                      # Why subtract 1?
echo "$instances instance(s) of this script running."
echo "\[Hit Ctl-C to exit.\]"; echo


sleep 1              # Wait.
sh $0                # Play it again, Sam.

exit 0               # Not necessary; script will never get to here.
                     # Why not?

#  After exiting with a Ctl-C,
#+ do all the spawned instances of the script die?
#  If so, why?

# Note:
# ----
# Be careful not to run this script too long.
# It will eventually eat up too many system resources.

#  Is having a script spawn multiple instances of itself
#+ an advisable scripting technique.
#  Why or why not?

Generally, a Bash _builtin_ does not fork a subprocess when it executes within a script. An external system command or filter in a script usually _will_ fork a subprocess.

A builtin may be a synonym to a system command of the same name, but Bash reimplements it internally. For example, the Bash **echo** command is not the same as /bin/echo, although their behavior is almost identical.

#!/bin/bash

echo "This line uses the \\"echo\\" builtin."
/bin/echo "This line uses the /bin/echo system command."

A _keyword_ is a _reserved_ word, token or operator. Keywords have a special meaning to the shell, and indeed are the building blocks of the shell's syntax. As examples, _for_, _while_, _do_, and _!_ are keywords. Similar to a [builtin](#BUILTINREF), a keyword is hard-coded into Bash, but unlike a _builtin_, a keyword is not in itself a command, but _a subunit of a command construct_. [\[59\]](#FTN.AEN8650)

**I/O**

**echo**

prints (to stdout) an expression or variable (see [Example 4-1](#EX9)).

echo Hello
echo $a

An **echo** requires the \-e option to print escaped characters. See [Example 5-2](#ESCAPED).

Normally, each **echo** command prints a terminal newline, but the \-n option suppresses this.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

An **echo** can be used to feed a sequence of commands down a pipe.

if echo "$VAR" | grep -q txt   # if \[\[ $VAR = \*txt\* \]\]
then
  echo "$VAR contains the substring sequence \\"txt\\""
fi

![Note](../images/note.gif)

An **echo**, in combination with [command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF) can set a variable.

**a=\`echo "HELLO" | tr A-Z a-z\`**

See also [Example 16-22](#LOWERCASE), [Example 16-3](#EX57), [Example 16-47](#MONTHLYPMT), and [Example 16-48](#BASE).

Be aware that **echo \`command\`** deletes any linefeeds that the output of _command_ generates.

The [$IFS](#IFSREF) (internal field separator) variable normally contains \\n (linefeed) as one of its set of [whitespace](#WHITESPACEREF) characters. Bash therefore splits the output of _command_ at linefeeds into arguments to **echo**. Then **echo** outputs these arguments, separated by spaces.

bash$ **ls -l /usr/share/apps/kjezz/sounds**
\-rw-r--r--    1 root     root         1407 Nov  7  2000 reflect.au
 -rw-r--r--    1 root     root          362 Nov  7  2000 seconds.au

bash$ **echo \`ls -l /usr/share/apps/kjezz/sounds\`**
total 40 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 716 Nov 7 2000 reflect.au -rw-r--r-- 1 root root ...
	      

So, how can we embed a linefeed within an [echoed](#ECHOREF) character string?

\# Embedding a linefeed?
echo "Why doesn't this string \\n split on two lines?"
# Doesn't split.

# Let's try something else.

echo
	     
echo $"A line of text containing
a linefeed."
# Prints as two distinct lines (embedded linefeed).
# But, is the "$" variable prefix really necessary?

echo

echo "This string splits
on two lines."
# No, the "$" is not needed.

echo
echo "---------------"
echo

echo -n $"Another line of text containing
a linefeed."
# Prints as two distinct lines (embedded linefeed).
# Even the -n option fails to suppress the linefeed here.

echo
echo
echo "---------------"
echo
echo

# However, the following doesn't work as expected.
# Why not? Hint: Assignment to a variable.
string1=$"Yet another line of text containing
a linefeed (maybe)."

echo $string1
# Yet another line of text containing a linefeed (maybe).
#                                    ^
# Linefeed becomes a space.

# Thanks, Steve Parker, for pointing this out.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

This command is a shell builtin, and not the same as /bin/echo, although its behavior is similar.

bash$ **type -a echo**
echo is a shell builtin
 echo is /bin/echo
	      

**printf**

The **printf**, formatted print, command is an enhanced **echo**. It is a limited variant of the _C_ language printf() library function, and its syntax is somewhat different.

**printf** _format-string_... _parameter_...

This is the Bash _builtin_ version of the /bin/printf or /usr/bin/printf command. See the **printf** [manpage](#MANREF) (of the system command) for in-depth coverage.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Older versions of Bash may not support **printf**.

**Example 15-2. _printf_ in action**

**read**

"Reads" the value of a variable from stdin, that is, interactively fetches input from the keyboard. The \-a option lets **read** get array variables (see [Example 27-6](#EX67)).

**Example 15-3. Variable assignment, using _read_**

#!/bin/bash
# "Reading" variables.

echo -n "Enter the value of variable 'var1': "
# The -n option to echo suppresses newline.

read var1
# Note no '$' in front of var1, since it is being set.

echo "var1 = $var1"


echo

# A single 'read' statement can set multiple variables.
echo -n "Enter the values of variables 'var2' and 'var3' "
echo =n "(separated by a space or tab): "
read var2 var3
echo "var2 = $var2      var3 = $var3"
#  If you input only one value,
#+ the other variable(s) will remain unset (null).

exit 0

A **read** without an associated variable assigns its input to the dedicated variable [$REPLY](#REPLYREF).

**Example 15-4. What happens when _read_ has no variable**

#!/bin/bash
# read-novar.sh

echo

# -------------------------- #
echo -n "Enter a value: "
read var
echo "\\"var\\" = "$var""
# Everything as expected here.
# -------------------------- #

echo

# ------------------------------------------------------------------- #
echo -n "Enter another value: "
read           #  No variable supplied for 'read', therefore...
               #+ Input to 'read' assigned to default variable, $REPLY.
var="$REPLY"
echo "\\"var\\" = "$var""
# This is equivalent to the first code block.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------- #

echo
echo "========================="
echo


#  This example is similar to the "reply.sh" script.
#  However, this one shows that $REPLY is available
#+ even after a 'read' to a variable in the conventional way.


# ================================================================= #

#  In some instances, you might wish to discard the first value read.
#  In such cases, simply ignore the $REPLY variable.

{ # Code block.
read            # Line 1, to be discarded.
read line2      # Line 2, saved in variable.
  } <$0
echo "Line 2 of this script is:"
echo "$line2"   #   # read-novar.sh
echo            #   #!/bin/bash  line discarded.

# See also the soundcard-on.sh script.

exit 0

Normally, inputting a **\\** suppresses a newline during input to a **read**. The \-r option causes an inputted **\\** to be interpreted literally.

**Example 15-5. Multi-line input to _read_**

#!/bin/bash

echo

echo "Enter a string terminated by a \\\\, then press <ENTER>."
echo "Then, enter a second string (no \\\\ this time), and again press <ENTER>."

read var1     # The "\\" suppresses the newline, when reading $var1.
              #     first line \\
              #     second line

echo "var1 = $var1"
#     var1 = first line second line

#  For each line terminated by a "\\"
#+ you get a prompt on the next line to continue feeding characters into var1.

echo; echo

echo "Enter another string terminated by a \\\\ , then press <ENTER>."
read -r var2  # The -r option causes the "\\" to be read literally.
              #     first line \\

echo "var2 = $var2"
#     var2 = first line \\

# Data entry terminates with the first <ENTER>.

echo 

exit 0

The **read** command has some interesting options that permit echoing a prompt and even reading keystrokes without hitting **ENTER**.

\# Read a keypress without hitting ENTER.

read -s -n1 -p "Hit a key " keypress
echo; echo "Keypress was "\\"$keypress\\""."

# -s option means do not echo input.
# -n N option means accept only N characters of input.
# -p option means echo the following prompt before reading input.

# Using these options is tricky, since they need to be in the correct order.

The \-n option to **read** also allows detection of the **arrow keys** and certain of the other unusual keys.

**Example 15-6. Detecting the arrow keys**

#!/bin/bash
# arrow-detect.sh: Detects the arrow keys, and a few more.
# Thank you, Sandro Magi, for showing me how.

# --------------------------------------------
# Character codes generated by the keypresses.

arrowdown='\\\[B'
arrowrt='\\\[C'
arrowleft='\\\[D'
insert='\\\[2'
delete='\\\[3'
# --------------------------------------------

SUCCESS=0
OTHER=65

echo -n "Press a key...  "
# May need to also press ENTER if a key not listed above pressed.
read -n3 key                      # Read 3 characters.

echo -n "$key" | grep "$arrowup"  #Check if character code detected.
if \[ "$?" -eq $SUCCESS \]
then
  echo "Up-arrow key pressed."

done

# ========================================= #

#  Exercise:
#  --------
#  1) Add detection of the "Home," "End," "PgUp," and "PgDn" keys.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The \-n option to **read** will not detect the **ENTER** (newline) key.

The \-t option to **read** permits timed input (see [Example 9-4](#TOUT) and [Example A-41](#QKY)).

The \-u option takes the [file descriptor](#FDREF) of the target file.

The **read** command may also "read" its variable value from a file [redirected](#IOREDIRREF) to stdin. If the file contains more than one line, only the first line is assigned to the variable. If **read** has more than one parameter, then each of these variables gets assigned a successive [whitespace-delineated](#WHITESPACEREF) string. Caution!

**Example 15-7. Using _read_ with [file redirection](#IOREDIRREF)**

#!/bin/bash

read var1 <data-file
echo "var1 = $var1"
# var1 set to the entire first line of the input file "data-file"

read var2 var3 <data-file
echo "var2 = $var2   var3 = $var3"
# Note non-intuitive behavior of "read" here.
# 1) Rewinds back to the beginning of input file.
# 2) Each variable is now set to a corresponding string,
#    separated by whitespace, rather than to an entire line of text.
# 3) The final variable gets the remainder of the line.
# 4) If there are more variables to be set than whitespace-terminated strings
#    on the first line of the file, then the excess variables remain empty.

echo "------------------------------------------------"

# How to resolve the above problem with a loop:
while read line
do
  echo "$line"
done <data-file
# Thanks, Heiner Steven for pointing this out.

echo "------------------------------------------------"

# Use $IFS (Internal Field Separator variable) to split a line of input to
# "read", if you do not want the default to be whitespace.

echo "List of all users:"
OIFS=$IFS; IFS=:       # /etc/passwd uses ":" for field separator.
while read name passwd uid gid fullname ignore
do
  echo "$name ($fullname)"
done </etc/passwd   # I/O redirection.
IFS=$OIFS              # Restore original $IFS.
# This code snippet also by Heiner Steven.



#  Setting the $IFS variable within the loop itself
#+ eliminates the need for storing the original $IFS
#+ in a temporary variable.
#  Thanks, Dim Segebart, for pointing this out.
echo "------------------------------------------------"
echo "List of all users:"

while IFS=: read name passwd uid gid fullname ignore
do
  echo "$name ($fullname)"
done </etc/passwd   # I/O redirection.

echo
echo "\\$IFS still $IFS"

exit 0

![Note](../images/note.gif)

[Piping](#PIPEREF) output to a _read_, using [echo](#ECHOREF) to set variables [will fail](#BADREAD0).

Yet, piping the output of [cat](#CATREF) _seems_ to work.

cat file1 file2 |
while read line
do
echo $line
done

However, as BjÃ¶n Eriksson shows:

**Example 15-8. Problems reading from a pipe**

#!/bin/sh
# readpipe.sh
# This example contributed by Bjon Eriksson.

### shopt -s lastpipe

last="(null)"
cat $0 |
while read line
do
    echo "{$line}"
    last=$line
done

echo
echo "++++++++++++++++++++++"
printf "\\nAll done, last: $last\\n" #  The output of this line
                                   #+ changes if you uncomment line 5.
                                   #  (Bash, version -ge 4.2 required.)

exit 0  # End of code.
        # (Partial) output of script follows.
        # The 'echo' supplies extra brackets.

#############################################

./readpipe.sh 

{#!/bin/sh}
{last="(null)"}
{cat $0 |}
{while read line}
{do}
{echo "{$line}"}
{last=$line}
{done}
{printf "nAll done, last: $lastn"}


All done, last: (null)

The variable (last) is set within the loop/subshell
but its value does not persist outside the loop.

The _gendiff_ script, usually found in /usr/bin on many Linux distros, pipes the output of [find](#FINDREF) to a _while read_ construct.

find $1 \\( -name "\*$2" -o -name ".\*$2" \\) -print |
while read f; do
. . .

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

It is possible to _paste_ text into the input field of a _read_ (but _not_ multiple lines!). See [Example A-38](#PADSW).

**Filesystem**

**cd**

The familiar **cd** change directory command finds use in scripts where execution of a command requires being in a specified directory.

(cd /source/directory && tar cf - . ) | (cd /dest/directory && tar xpvf -)

\[from the [previously cited](#COXEX) example by Alan Cox\]

The \-P (physical) option to **cd** causes it to ignore symbolic links.

**cd -** changes to [$OLDPWD](#OLDPWD), the previous working directory.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

The **cd** command does not function as expected when presented with two forward slashes.

bash$ **cd //**
bash$ **pwd**
//
	      

The output should, of course, be /. This is a problem both from the command-line and in a script.

**pwd**

Print Working Directory. This gives the user's (or script's) current directory (see [Example 15-9](#EX37)). The effect is identical to reading the value of the builtin variable [$PWD](#PWDREF).

**pushd**, **popd**, **dirs**

This command set is a mechanism for bookmarking working directories, a means of moving back and forth through directories in an orderly manner. A pushdown [stack](#STACKDEFREF) is used to keep track of directory names. Options allow various manipulations of the directory stack.

**pushd dir-name** pushes the path _dir-name_ onto the directory stack (to the _top_ of the stack) and simultaneously changes the current working directory to _dir-name_

**popd** removes (pops) the top directory path name off the directory stack and simultaneously changes the current working directory to the directory now at the _top_ of the stack.

**dirs** lists the contents of the directory stack (compare this with the [$DIRSTACK](#DIRSTACKREF) variable). A successful **pushd** or **popd** will automatically invoke **dirs**.

Scripts that require various changes to the current working directory without hard-coding the directory name changes can make good use of these commands. Note that the implicit $DIRSTACK array variable, accessible from within a script, holds the contents of the directory stack.

**Example 15-9. Changing the current working directory**

#!/bin/bash

dir1=/usr/local
dir2=/var/spool

pushd $dir1
# Will do an automatic 'dirs' (list directory stack to stdout).
echo "Now in directory \`pwd\`." # Uses back-quoted 'pwd'.

# Now, do some stuff in directory 'dir1'.
pushd $dir2
echo "Now in directory \`pwd\`."

# Now, do some stuff in directory 'dir2'.
echo "The top entry in the DIRSTACK array is $DIRSTACK."
popd
echo "Now back in directory \`pwd\`."

# Now, do some more stuff in directory 'dir1'.
popd
echo "Now back in original working directory \`pwd\`."

exit 0

# What happens if you don't 'popd' -- then exit the script?
# Which directory do you end up in? Why?

**Variables**

**let**

The **let** command carries out _arithmetic_ operations on variables. [\[60\]](#FTN.AEN9009) In many cases, it functions as a less complex version of [expr](#EXPRREF).

**Example 15-10. Letting _let_ do arithmetic.**

#!/bin/bash

echo

let a=11            # Same as 'a=11'
let a=a+5           # Equivalent to  let "a = a + 5"
                    # (Double quotes and spaces make it more readable.)
echo "11 + 5 = $a"  # 16

let "a <<= 3"       # Equivalent to  let "a = a << 3"
echo "\\"\\$a\\" (=16) left-shifted 3 places = $a"
                    # 128

let "a /= 4"        # Equivalent to  let "a = a / 4"
echo "128 / 4 = $a" # 32

let "a -= 5"        # Equivalent to  let "a = a - 5"
echo "32 - 5 = $a"  # 27

let "a \*=  10"      # Equivalent to  let "a = a \* 10"
echo "27 \* 10 = $a" # 270

let "a %= 8"        # Equivalent to  let "a = a % 8"
echo "270 modulo 8 = $a  (270 / 8 = 33, remainder $a)"
                    # 6


# Does "let" permit C-style operators?
# Yes, just as the (( ... )) double-parentheses construct does.

let a++             # C-style (post) increment.
echo "6++ = $a"     # 6++ = 7
let a--             # C-style decrement.
echo "7-- = $a"     # 7-- = 6
# Of course, ++a, etc., also allowed . . .
echo


# Trinary operator.

# Note that $a is 6, see above.
let "t = a<7?7:11"   # True
echo $t  # 7

let a++
let "t = a<7?7:11"   # False
echo $t  #     11

exit

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

The _let_ command can, in certain contexts, return a surprising [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF).

\# Evgeniy Ivanov points out:

var=0
echo $?     # 0
            # As expected.

let var++
echo $?     # 1
            # The command was successful, so why isn't $?=0 ???
            # Anomaly!

let var++
echo $?     # 0
            # As expected.


# Likewise . . .

let var=0
echo $?     # 1
            # The command was successful, so why isn't $?=0 ???

#  However, as Jeff Gorak points out,
#+ this is part of the design spec for 'let' . . .
# "If the last ARG evaluates to 0, let returns 1;
#  let returns 0 otherwise." \['help let'\]

**eval**

**eval arg1 \[arg2\] ... \[argN\]**

Combines the arguments in an expression or list of expressions and _evaluates_ them. Any variables within the expression are expanded. The net result is to **convert a string into a command**.

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

The **eval** command can be used for code generation from the command-line or within a script.

bash$ **command\_string="ps ax"**
bash$ **process="ps ax"**
bash$ **eval "$command\_string" | grep "$process"**
26973 pts/3    R+     0:00 grep --color ps ax
 26974 pts/3    R+     0:00 ps ax
	      

Each invocation of _eval_ forces a re-_evaluation_ of its arguments.

a='$b'
b='$c'
c=d

echo $a             # $b
                    # First level.
eval echo $a        # $c
                    # Second level.
eval eval echo $a   # d
                    # Third level.

# Thank you, E. Choroba.

**Example 15-11. Showing the effect of _eval_**

#!/bin/bash

echo "version = $version"
eval major=${version/./;minor=}     #  Replaces '.' in version by ';minor='

echo $var                    # foobar

Here is another example of using _eval_ to _evaluate_ a complex expression, this one from an earlier version of YongYe's [Tetris game script](https://github.com/yongye/shell/blob/master/Tetris_Game.sh).

eval ${1}+=\\"${x} ${y} \\"

[Example A-53](#SAMORSE) uses _eval_ to convert [array](#ARRAYREF) elements into a command list.

The _eval_ command occurs in the older version of [indirect referencing](#IVRREF).

eval var=\\$$var

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

The _eval_ command can be used to [parameterize _brace expansion_](#BRACEEXPREF3).

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

The **eval** command can be risky, and normally should be avoided when there exists a reasonable alternative. An **eval $COMMANDS** executes the contents of _COMMANDS_, which may contain such unpleasant surprises as **rm -rf \***. Running an **eval** on unfamiliar code written by persons unknown is living dangerously.

**set**

The **set** command changes the value of internal script variables/options. One use for this is to toggle [option flags](#OPTIONSREF) which help determine the behavior of the script. Another application for it is to reset the [positional parameters](#POSPARAMREF) that a script sees as the result of a command (**set \`command\`**). The script can then parse the [fields](#FIELDREF) of the command output.

**Example 15-16. Using _set_ with positional parameters**

#!/bin/bash
# ex34.sh
# Script "set-test"

# Invoke this script with three command-line parameters,
# for example, "sh ex34.sh one two three".

echo
echo "Positional parameters before  set \\\`uname -a\\\` :"
echo "Command-line argument #1 = $1"
echo "Command-line argument #2 = $2"
echo "Command-line argument #3 = $3"


set \`uname -a\` # Sets the positional parameters to the output
               # of the command \`uname -a\`

echo
echo +++++
echo $\_        # +++++
# Flags set in script.
echo $-        # hB
#                Anomalous behavior?
echo

echo "Positional parameters after  set \\\`uname -a\\\` :"
# $1, $2, $3, etc. reinitialized to result of \`uname -a\`
echo "Field #1 of 'uname -a' = $1"
echo "Field #2 of 'uname -a' = $2"
echo "Field #3 of 'uname -a' = $3"
echo \\#\\#\\#
echo $\_        # ###
echo

exit 0

More fun with positional parameters.

**Example 15-17. Reversing the positional parameters**

#!/bin/bash
# revposparams.sh: Reverse positional parameters.
# Script by Dan Jacobson, with stylistic revisions by document author.


set a\\ b c d\\ e;
#     ^      ^     Spaces escaped 
#       ^ ^        Spaces not escaped
OIFS=$IFS; IFS=:;
#              ^   Saving old IFS and setting new one.

echo

until \[ $# -eq 0 \]
do          #      Step through positional parameters.
  echo "### k0 = "$k""     # Before
  k=$1:$k;  #      Append each pos param to loop variable.
#     ^
  echo "### k = "$k""      # After
  echo
  shift;
done

set $k  #  Set new positional parameters.
echo -
echo $# #  Count of positional parameters.
echo -
echo

for i   #  Omitting the "in list" sets the variable -- i --
        #+ to the positional parameters.
do
  echo $i  # Display new positional parameters.
done

IFS=$OIFS  # Restore IFS.

#  Question:
#  Is it necessary to set an new IFS, internal field separator,
#+ in order for this script to work properly?
#  What happens if you don't? Try it.
#  And, why use the new IFS -- a colon -- in line 17,
#+ to append to the loop variable?
#  What is the purpose of this?

exit 0

$ ./revposparams.sh

### k0 = 
### k = a b

### k0 = a b
### k = c a b

### k0 = c a b
### k = d e c a b

Invoking **set** without any options or arguments simply lists all the [environmental](#ENVREF) and other variables that have been initialized.

bash$ **set**
AUTHORCOPY=/home/bozo/posts
 BASH=/bin/bash
 BASH\_VERSION=$'2.05.8(1)-release'
 ...
 XAUTHORITY=/home/bozo/.Xauthority
 \_=/etc/bashrc
 variable22=abc
 variable23=xzy
	      

Using **set** with the \-- option explicitly assigns the contents of a variable to the positional parameters. If no variable follows the \-- it _unsets_ the positional parameters.

**Example 15-18. Reassigning the positional parameters**

#!/bin/bash

variable="one two three four five"

set -- $variable
# Sets positional parameters to the contents of "$variable".

first\_param=$1
second\_param=$2
shift; shift        # Shift past first two positional params.
# shift 2             also works.
remaining\_params="$\*"

echo
echo "first parameter = $first\_param"             # one
echo "second parameter = $second\_param"           # two
echo "remaining parameters = $remaining\_params"   # three four five

echo; echo

# Again.
set -- $variable
first\_param=$1
second\_param=$2
echo "first parameter = $first\_param"             # one
echo "second parameter = $second\_param"           # two

# ======================================================

set --
# Unsets positional parameters if no variable specified.

first\_param=$1
second\_param=$2
echo "first parameter = $first\_param"             # (null value)
echo "second parameter = $second\_param"           # (null value)

exit 0

See also [Example 11-2](#EX22A) and [Example 16-56](#EX33A).

**unset**

The **unset** command deletes a shell variable, effectively setting it to _null_. Note that this command does not affect positional parameters.

bash$ **unset PATH**

bash$ **echo $PATH**

bash$ 

**Example 15-19. "Unsetting" a variable**

#!/bin/bash
# unset.sh: Unsetting a variable.

variable=hello                       #  Initialized.
echo "variable = $variable"

unset variable                       #  Unset.
                                     #  In this particular context,
                                     #+ same effect as:   variable=
echo "(unset) variable = $variable"  #  $variable is null.

if \[ -z "$variable" \]                #  Try a string-length test.
then
  echo "\\$variable has zero length."
fi

exit 0

![Note](../images/note.gif)

In most contexts, an _undeclared_ variable and one that has been _unset_ are equivalent. However, the [${parameter:-default}](#UNDDR) parameter substitution construct can distinguish between the two.

**export**

The **export** [\[61\]](#FTN.AEN9199) command makes available variables to all child processes of the running script or shell. One important use of the **export** command is in [startup files](#FILESREF1), to initialize and make accessible [environmental variables](#ENVREF) to subsequent user processes.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Unfortunately, [there is no way to export variables back to the parent process](#PARCHILDPROBREF), to the process that called or invoked the script or shell.

**Example 15-20. Using _export_ to pass a variable to an embedded _awk_ script**

#!/bin/bash

#  Yet another version of the "column totaler" script (col-totaler.sh)
#+ that adds up a specified column (of numbers) in the target file.
#  This uses the environment to pass a script variable to 'awk' . . .
#+ and places the awk script in a variable.


ARGS=2
E\_WRONGARGS=85

if \[ $# -ne "$ARGS" \] # Check for proper number of command-line args.
then
   echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` filename column-number"
   exit $E\_WRONGARGS
fi

filename=$1
column\_number=$2

#===== Same as original script, up to this point =====#

export column\_number
# Export column number to environment, so it's available for retrieval.


# -----------------------------------------------
awkscript='{ total += $ENVIRON\["column\_number"\] }
END { print total }'
# Yes, a variable can hold an awk script.
# -----------------------------------------------

# Now, run the awk script.
awk "$awkscript" "$filename"

# Thanks, Stephane Chazelas.

exit 0

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

It is possible to initialize and export variables in the same operation, as in **export var1=xxx**.

However, as Greg Keraunen points out, in certain situations this may have a different effect than setting a variable, then exporting it.

bash$ **export var=(a b); echo ${var\[0\]}**
(a b)

bash$ **var=(a b); export var; echo ${var\[0\]}**
a
	      

![Note](../images/note.gif)

A variable to be exported may require special treatment. See [Example M-2](#BASHPROF).

**declare**, **typeset**

The [declare](#DECLAREREF) and [typeset](#DECLAREREF) commands specify and/or restrict properties of variables.

**readonly**

Same as [declare -r](#DECLAREREF), sets a variable as read-only, or, in effect, as a constant. Attempts to change the variable fail with an error message. This is the shell analog of the _C_ language **const** type qualifier.

**getopts**

This powerful tool parses command-line arguments passed to the script. This is the Bash analog of the [getopt](#GETOPTY) external command and the _getopt_ library function familiar to _C_ programmers. It permits passing and concatenating multiple options [\[62\]](#FTN.AEN9289) and associated arguments to a script (for example **scriptname -abc -e /usr/local**).

The **getopts** construct uses two implicit variables. $OPTIND is the argument pointer (_OPTion INDex_) and $OPTARG (_OPTion ARGument_) the (optional) argument attached to an option. A colon following the option name in the declaration tags that option as having an associated argument.

A **getopts** construct usually comes packaged in a [while loop](#WHILELOOPREF), which processes the options and arguments one at a time, then increments the implicit $OPTIND variable to point to the next.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

1.  The arguments passed from the command-line to the script must be preceded by a dash (\-). It is the prefixed \- that lets **getopts** recognize command-line arguments as _options_. In fact, **getopts** will not process arguments without the prefixed \-, and will terminate option processing at the first argument encountered lacking them.
    
2.  The **getopts** template differs slightly from the standard [while loop](#WHILELOOPREF), in that it lacks condition brackets.
    
3.  The **getopts** construct is a highly functional replacement for the traditional [getopt](#GETOPTY) external command.
    

while getopts ":abcde:fg" Option
# Initial declaration.
# a, b, c, d, e, f, and g are the options (flags) expected.
# The : after option 'e' shows it will have an argument passed with it.
do
  case $Option in
    a ) # Do something with variable 'a'.
    b ) # Do something with variable 'b'.
    ...
    e)  # Do something with 'e', and also with $OPTARG,
        # which is the associated argument passed with option 'e'.
    ...
    g ) # Do something with variable 'g'.
  esac
done
shift $(($OPTIND - 1))
# Move argument pointer to next.

# All this is not nearly as complicated as it looks <grin>.

**Example 15-21. Using _getopts_ to read the options/arguments passed to a script**

#!/bin/bash
# ex33.sh: Exercising getopts and OPTIND
#          Script modified 10/09/03 at the suggestion of Bill Gradwohl.


# Here we observe how 'getopts' processes command-line arguments to script.
# The arguments are parsed as "options" (flags) and associated arguments.

# Try invoking this script with:
#   'scriptname -mn'
#   'scriptname -oq qOption' (qOption can be some arbitrary string.)
#   'scriptname -qXXX -r'
#
#   'scriptname -qr'
#+      - Unexpected result, takes "r" as the argument to option "q"
#   'scriptname -q -r' 
#+      - Unexpected result, same as above
#   'scriptname -mnop -mnop'  - Unexpected result
#   (OPTIND is unreliable at stating where an option came from.)
#
#  If an option expects an argument ("flag:"), then it will grab
#+ whatever is next on the command-line.

NO\_ARGS=0 
E\_OPTERROR=85

if \[ $# -eq "$NO\_ARGS" \]    # Script invoked with no command-line args?
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` options (-mnopqrs)"

                            # Usage: scriptname -options
                            # Note: dash (-) necessary
fi  


while getopts ":mnopq:rs" Option
do
  case $Option in

                  with argument \\"$OPTARG\\"   \[OPTIND=${OPTIND}\]";;
    #  Note that option 'q' must have an associated argument,
    #+ otherwise it falls through to the default.
    r | s ) echo "Scenario #5: option -$Option-";;
    \*     ) echo "Unimplemented option chosen.";;   # Default.
  esac
done

shift $(($OPTIND - 1))
#  Decrements the argument pointer so it points to next argument.
#  $1 now references the first non-option item supplied on the command-line
#+ if one exists.

exit $?

#   As Bill Gradwohl states,
#  "The getopts mechanism allows one to specify:  scriptname -mnop -mnop
#+  but there is no reliable way to differentiate what came
#+ from where by using OPTIND."
#  There are, however, workarounds.

**Script Behavior**

**source**, . ([dot](#DOTREF) command)

This command, when invoked from the command-line, executes a script. Within a script, a **source file-name** loads the file file-name. _Sourcing_ a file (dot-command) _imports_ code into the script, appending to the script (same effect as the **#include** directive in a _C_ program). The net result is the same as if the "sourced" lines of code were physically present in the body of the script. This is useful in situations when multiple scripts use a common data file or function library.

**Example 15-22. "Including" a data file**

#!/bin/bash
#  Note that this example must be invoked with bash, i.e., bash ex38.sh
#+ not  sh ex38.sh !

. data-file    # Load a data file.
# Same effect as "source data-file", but more portable.

#  The file "data-file" must be present in current working directory,
#+ since it is referred to by its basename.

# Now, let's reference some data from that file.

echo "variable1 (from data-file) = $variable1"
echo "variable3 (from data-file) = $variable3"

let "sum = $variable2 + $variable4"
echo "Sum of variable2 + variable4 (from data-file) = $sum"
echo "message1 (from data-file) is \\"$message1\\""
#                                  Escaped quotes
echo "message2 (from data-file) is \\"$message2\\""

print\_message This is the message-print function in the data-file.


exit $?

File data-file for [Example 15-22](#EX38), above. Must be present in same directory.

\# This is a data file loaded by a script.
# Files of this type may contain variables, functions, etc.
# It loads with a 'source' or '.' command from a shell script.

# Let's initialize some variables.

variable1=23
variable2=474
variable3=5
variable4=97

message1="Greetings from \*\*\* line $LINENO \*\*\* of the data file!"
message2="Enough for now. Goodbye."

print\_message ()
{   # Echoes any message passed to it.

  if \[ -z "$1" \]
  then
    return 1 # Error, if argument missing.
  fi

  echo

  until \[ -z "$1" \]
  do             # Step through arguments passed to function.
    echo -n "$1" # Echo args one at a time, suppressing line feeds.
    echo -n " "  # Insert spaces between words.
    shift        # Next one.
  done  

  echo

  return 0
}

If the _sourced_ file is itself an executable script, then it will run, then return control to the script that called it. A _sourced_ executable script may use a [return](#RETURNREF) for this purpose.

Arguments may be (optionally) passed to the _sourced_ file as [positional parameters](#POSPARAMREF1).

source $filename $arg1 arg2

It is even possible for a script to _source_ itself, though this does not seem to have any practical applications.

**Example 15-23. A (useless) script that sources itself**

#!/bin/bash
# self-source.sh: a script sourcing itself "recursively."
# From "Stupid Script Tricks," Volume II.

MAXPASSCNT=100    # Maximum number of execution passes.

echo -n  "$pass\_count  "
#  At first execution pass, this just echoes two blank spaces,
#+ since $pass\_count still uninitialized.

let "pass\_count += 1"
#  Assumes the uninitialized variable $pass\_count
#+ can be incremented the first time around.
#  This works with Bash and pdksh, but
#+ it relies on non-portable (and possibly dangerous) behavior.
#  Better would be to initialize $pass\_count to 0 before incrementing.

while \[ "$pass\_count" -le $MAXPASSCNT \]
do
  . $0   # Script "sources" itself, rather than calling itself.
         # ./$0 (which would be true recursion) doesn't work here. Why?
done  

#  What occurs here is not actually recursion,
#+ since the script effectively "expands" itself, i.e.,
#+ generates a new section of code
#+ with each pass through the 'while' loop',
#  with each 'source' in line 20.
#
#  Of course, the script interprets each newly 'sourced' "#!" line
#+ as a comment, and not as the start of a new script.

echo

exit 0   # The net effect is counting from 1 to 100.
         # Very impressive.

# Exercise:
# --------
# Write a script that uses this trick to actually do something useful.

**exit**

Unconditionally terminates a script. [\[63\]](#FTN.AEN9393) The **exit** command may optionally take an integer argument, which is returned to the shell as the [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) of the script. It is good practice to end all but the simplest scripts with an **exit 0**, indicating a successful run.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

If a script terminates with an **exit** lacking an argument, the exit status of the script is the exit status of the last command executed in the script, not counting the **exit**. This is equivalent to an **exit $?**.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

An **exit** command may also be used to terminate a [subshell](#SUBSHELLSREF).

**exec**

This shell builtin replaces the current process with a specified command. Normally, when the shell encounters a command, it [forks off](#FORKREF) a child process to actually execute the command. Using the **exec** builtin, the shell does not fork, and the command _exec_'ed replaces the shell. When used in a script, therefore, it forces an exit from the script when the **exec**'ed command terminates. [\[64\]](#FTN.AEN9425)

**Example 15-24. Effects of _exec_**

#!/bin/bash

exec echo "Exiting \\"$0\\" at line $LINENO."   # Exit from script here.
# $LINENO is an internal Bash variable set to the line number it's on.

# ----------------------------------
# The following lines never execute.

echo "This echo fails to echo."

exit 99                       #  This script will not exit here.
                              #  Check exit value after script terminates
                              #+ with an 'echo $?'.
                              #  It will \*not\* be 99.

**Example 15-25. A script that _exec's_ itself**

#!/bin/bash
# self-exec.sh

# Note: Set permissions on this script to 555 or 755,
#       then call it with ./self-exec.sh or sh ./self-exec.sh.

echo

echo "This line appears ONCE in the script, yet it keeps echoing."
echo "The PID of this instance of the script is still $$."
#     Demonstrates that a subshell is not forked off.

echo "==================== Hit Ctl-C to exit ===================="

sleep 1

exec $0   #  Spawns another instance of this same script
          #+ that replaces the previous one.

echo "This line will never echo!"  # Why not?

exit 99                            # Will not exit here!
                                   # Exit code will not be 99!

An **exec** also serves to [reassign file descriptors](#USINGEXECREF). For example, **exec <zzz-file** replaces stdin with the file zzz-file.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The \-exec option to [find](#FINDREF) is _not_ the same as the **exec** shell builtin.

**shopt**

This command permits changing _shell options_ on the fly (see [Example 25-1](#AL) and [Example 25-2](#UNAL)). It often appears in the Bash [startup files](#FILESREF1), but also has its uses in scripts. Needs [version 2](#BASH2REF) or later of Bash.

shopt -s cdspell
# Allows minor misspelling of directory names with 'cd'
# Option -s sets, -u unsets.

cd /hpme  # Oops! Mistyped '/home'.
pwd       # /home
          # The shell corrected the misspelling.

**caller**

Putting a **caller** command inside a [function](#FUNCTIONREF) echoes to stdout information about the _caller_ of that function.

#!/bin/bash

function1 ()
{
  # Inside function1 ().
  caller 0   # Tell me about it.
}

function1    # Line 9 of script.

# 9 main test.sh
# ^                 Line number that the function was called from.
#   ^^^^            Invoked from "main" part of script.
#        ^^^^^^^    Name of calling script.

caller 0     # Has no effect because it's not inside a function.

A **caller** command can also return _caller_ information from a script [sourced](#SOURCEREF) within another script. Analogous to a function, this is a "subroutine call."

You may find this command useful in debugging.

**Commands**

**true**

A command that returns a successful (zero) [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF), but does nothing else.

bash$ **true**
bash$ **echo $?**
0
	      

\# Endless loop
while true   # alias for ":"
do
   operation-1
   operation-2
   ...
   operation-n
   # Need a way to break out of loop or script will hang.
done

**false**

A command that returns an unsuccessful [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF), but does nothing else.

bash$ **false**
bash$ **echo $?**
1
	      

\# Testing "false" 
if false
then
  echo "false evaluates \\"true\\""
else
  echo "false evaluates \\"false\\""
fi
# false evaluates "false"


# Looping while "false" (null loop)
while false
do
   # The following code will not execute.
   operation-1
   operation-2
   ...
   operation-n
   # Nothing happens!
done   

**type \[cmd\]**

Similar to the [which](#WHICHREF) external command, **type cmd** identifies "cmd." Unlike **which**, **type** is a Bash builtin. The useful \-a option to **type** identifies _keywords_ and _builtins_, and also locates system commands with identical names.

bash$ **type '\['**
\[ is a shell builtin
bash$ **type -a '\['**
\[ is a shell builtin
 \[ is /usr/bin/\[

bash$ **type type**
type is a shell builtin
	      

The **type** command can be useful for [testing whether a certain command exists](#DEVNULLREDIRECT).

**hash \[cmds\]**

Records the _path_ name of specified commands -- in the shell _hash table_ [\[65\]](#FTN.AEN9591) -- so the shell or script will not need to search the [$PATH](#PATHREF) on subsequent calls to those commands. When **hash** is called with no arguments, it simply lists the commands that have been hashed. The \-r option resets the hash table.

**bind**

The **bind** builtin displays or modifies _readline_ [\[66\]](#FTN.AEN9621) key bindings.

**help**

Gets a short usage summary of a shell builtin. This is the counterpart to [whatis](#WHATISREF), but for builtins. The display of _help_ information got a much-needed update in the [version 4 release](#BASH4REF) of Bash.

bash$ **help exit**
exit: exit \[n\]
    Exit the shell with a status of N.  If N is omitted, the exit status

15.1. Job Control Commands
==========================

Certain of the following job control commands take a _job identifier_ as an argument. See the [table](#JOBIDTABLE) at end of the chapter.

**jobs**

Lists the jobs running in the background, giving the _job number_. Not as useful as [ps](#PPSSREF).

![Note](../images/note.gif)

It is all too easy to confuse _jobs_ and _processes_. Certain [builtins](#BUILTINREF), such as **kill**, **disown**, and **wait** accept either a job number or a process number as an argument. The [fg](#FGREF), [bg](#BGREF) and **jobs** commands accept only a job number.

bash$ **sleep 100 &**
\[1\] 1384

bash $ **jobs**
\[1\]+  Running                 sleep 100 &

"1" is the job number (jobs are maintained by the current shell). "1384" is the [PID](#PPIDREF) or _process ID number_ (processes are maintained by the system). To kill this job/process, either a **kill %1** or a **kill 1384** works.

_Thanks, S.C._

**disown**

Remove job(s) from the shell's table of active jobs.

**fg**, **bg**

The **fg** command switches a job running in the background into the foreground. The **bg** command restarts a suspended job, and runs it in the background. If no job number is specified, then the **fg** or **bg** command acts upon the currently running job.

**wait**

Suspend script execution until all jobs running in background have terminated, or until the job number or process ID specified as an option terminates. Returns the [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) of waited-for command.

You may use the **wait** command to prevent a script from exiting before a background job finishes executing (this would create a dreaded [orphan process](#ZOMBIEREF)).

**Example 15-26. Waiting for a process to finish before proceeding**

#!/bin/bash

ROOT\_UID=0   # Only users with $UID 0 have root privileges.
E\_NOTROOT=65
E\_NOPARAMS=66

if \[ "$UID" -ne "$ROOT\_UID" \]
then
  echo "Must be root to run this script."
  # "Run along kid, it's past your bedtime."
  exit $E\_NOTROOT
fi  

if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` find-string"
  exit $E\_NOPARAMS
fi


echo "Updating 'locate' database..."
echo "This may take a while."
updatedb /usr &     # Must be run as root.

wait
# Don't run the rest of the script until 'updatedb' finished.
# You want the the database updated before looking up the file name.

locate $1

#  Without the 'wait' command, in the worse case scenario,
#+ the script would exit while 'updatedb' was still running,
#+ leaving it as an orphan process.

exit 0

Optionally, **wait** can take a _job identifier_ as an argument, for example, _wait%1_ or _wait $PPID_. [\[67\]](#FTN.AEN9753) See the [job id table](#JOBIDTABLE).

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

Within a script, running a command in the background with an ampersand (&) may cause the script to hang until **ENTER** is hit. This seems to occur with commands that write to stdout. It can be a major annoyance.

#!/bin/bash
# test.sh		  

ls -l &
echo "Done."

bash$ **./test.sh**
Done.
 \[bozo@localhost test-scripts\]$ total 1
 -rwxr-xr-x    1 bozo     bozo           34 Oct 11 15:09 test.sh
 \_

> Â Â Â Â 2.Â ScriptÂ exits.

> Â Â Â Â Â Â Â isÂ hanging.  

Placing a **wait** after the background command seems to remedy this.

#!/bin/bash
# test.sh		  

ls -l &
echo "Done."
wait

bash$ **./test.sh**
Done.
 \[bozo@localhost test-scripts\]$ total 1
 -rwxr-xr-x    1 bozo     bozo           34 Oct 11 15:09 test.sh
               

[Redirecting](#IOREDIRREF) the output of the command to a file or even to /dev/null also takes care of this problem.

**suspend**

This has a similar effect to **Control**\-**Z**, but it suspends the shell (the shell's parent process should resume it at an appropriate time).

**logout**

Exit a login shell, optionally specifying an [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF).

**times**

Gives statistics on the system time elapsed when executing commands, in the following form:

0m0.020s 0m0.020s

This capability is of relatively limited value, since it is not common to profile and benchmark shell scripts.

**kill**

Forcibly terminate a process by sending it an appropriate _terminate_ signal (see [Example 17-6](#KILLPROCESS)).

**Example 15-27. A script that kills itself**

#!/bin/bash
# self-destruct.sh

kill $$  # Script kills its own process here.
         # Recall that "$$" is the script's PID.

echo "This line will not echo."
# Instead, the shell sends a "Terminated" message to stdout.

exit 0   # Normal exit? No!

#  After this script terminates prematurely,
#+ what exit status does it return?
#
# sh self-destruct.sh
# echo $?
# 143
#
# 143 = 128 + 15
#             TERM signal

![Note](../images/note.gif)

**kill -l** lists all the [signals](#SIGNALD) (as does the file /usr/include/asm/signal.h). A **kill -9** is a _sure kill_, which will usually terminate a process that stubbornly refuses to die with a plain **kill**. Sometimes, a **kill -15** works. A _zombie_ process, that is, a child process that has terminated, but that the [parent process](#FORKREF) has not (yet) killed, cannot be killed by a logged-on user -- you can't kill something that is already dead -- but **init** will generally clean it up sooner or later.

**killall**

The **killall** command kills a running process by _name_, rather than by [process ID](#PROCESSIDREF). If there are multiple instances of a particular command running, then doing a _killall_ on that command will terminate them _all_.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

This refers to the **killall** command in /usr/bin, _not_ the [killall script](#KILLALL2REF) in /etc/rc.d/init.d.

**command**

The **command** directive disables aliases and functions for the command immediately following it.

bash$ **command ls**
              

![Note](../images/note.gif)

This is one of three shell directives that effect script command processing. The others are [builtin](#BLTREF) and [enable](#ENABLEREF).

**builtin**

Invoking **builtin BUILTIN\_COMMAND** runs the command _BUILTIN\_COMMAND_ as a shell [builtin](#BUILTINREF), temporarily disabling both functions and external system commands with the same name.

**enable**

This either enables or disables a shell builtin command. As an example, _enable -n kill_ disables the shell builtin [kill](#KILLREF), so that when Bash subsequently encounters _kill_, it invokes the external command /bin/kill.

The \-a option to _enable_ lists all the shell builtins, indicating whether or not they are enabled. The \-f filename option lets _enable_ load a [builtin](#BUILTINREF) as a shared library (DLL) module from a properly compiled object file. [\[68\]](#FTN.AEN9928).

**autoload**

This is a port to Bash of the _ksh_ autoloader. With **autoload** in place, a function with an _autoload_ declaration will load from an external file at its first invocation. [\[69\]](#FTN.AEN9949) This saves system resources.

Note that _autoload_ is not a part of the core Bash installation. It needs to be loaded in with _enable -f_ (see above).

**Table 15-1. Job identifiers**

Notation

Meaning

%N

Chapter 16. External Filters, Programs and Commands
===================================================

Standard UNIX commands make shell scripts more versatile. The power of scripts comes from coupling system commands and shell directives with simple programming constructs.

* * *

16.1. Basic Commands
====================

**The first commands a novice learns**

**ls**

The basic file "list" command. It is all too easy to underestimate the power of this humble command. For example, using the \-R, recursive option, **ls** provides a tree-like listing of a directory structure. Other useful options are \-S, sort listing by file size, \-t, sort by file modification time, \-v, sort by (numerical) version numbers embedded in the filenames, [\[70\]](#FTN.AEN10025) \-b, show escape characters, and \-i, show file inodes (see [Example 16-4](#IDELETE)).

bash$ **ls -l**

 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:44 chapter11.txt
 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Sep 14 18:44 chapter12.txt

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

The _ls_ command returns a non-zero [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) when attempting to list a non-existent file.

bash$ **ls abc**
ls: abc: No such file or directory

bash$ **echo $?**
2

**Example 16-1. Using _ls_ to create a table of contents for burning a CDR disk**

#!/bin/bash
# ex40.sh (burn-cd.sh)
# Script to automate burning a CDR.


SPEED=10         # May use higher speed if your hardware supports it.
IMAGEFILE=cdimage.iso
CONTENTSFILE=contents
# DEVICE=/dev/cdrom     For older versions of cdrecord
DEVICE="1,0,0"
DEFAULTDIR=/opt  # This is the directory containing the data to be burned.
                 # Make sure it exists.
                 # Exercise: Add a test for this.

# Uses Joerg Schilling's "cdrecord" package:
# http://www.fokus.fhg.de/usr/schilling/cdrecord.html

#  If this script invoked as an ordinary user, may need to suid cdrecord
#+ chmod u+s /usr/bin/cdrecord, as root.
#  Of course, this creates a security hole, though a relatively minor one.

if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  IMAGE\_DIRECTORY=$DEFAULTDIR
  # Default directory, if not specified on command-line.
else
    IMAGE\_DIRECTORY=$1
fi

# Create a "table of contents" file.
ls -lRF $IMAGE\_DIRECTORY > $IMAGE\_DIRECTORY/$CONTENTSFILE
# The "l" option gives a "long" file listing.
# The "R" option makes the listing recursive.
# The "F" option marks the file types (directories get a trailing /).
echo "Creating table of contents."

# Create an image file preparatory to burning it onto the CDR.
mkisofs -r -o $IMAGEFILE $IMAGE\_DIRECTORY
echo "Creating ISO9660 file system image ($IMAGEFILE)."

# Burn the CDR.
echo "Burning the disk."
echo "Please be patient, this will take a while."
wodim -v -isosize dev=$DEVICE $IMAGEFILE
#  In newer Linux distros, the "wodim" utility assumes the
#+ functionality of "cdrecord."
exitcode=$?
echo "Exit code = $exitcode"

exit $exitcode

**cat**, **tac**

**cat**, an acronym for _concatenate_, lists a file to stdout. When combined with redirection (\> or \>>), it is commonly used to concatenate files.

\# Uses of 'cat'
cat filename                          # Lists the file.

cat file.1 file.2 file.3 > file.123   # Combines three files into one.

The \-n option to **cat** inserts consecutive numbers before all lines of the target file(s). The \-b option numbers only the non-blank lines. The \-v option echoes nonprintable characters, using ^ notation. The \-s option squeezes multiple consecutive blank lines into a single blank line.

See also [Example 16-28](#LNUM) and [Example 16-24](#ROT13).

![Note](../images/note.gif)

In a [pipe](#PIPEREF), it may be more efficient to [redirect](#IOREDIRREF) the stdin to a file, rather than to **cat** the file.

cat filename | tr a-z A-Z

tr a-z A-Z < filename   #  Same effect, but starts one less process,
                        #+ and also dispenses with the pipe.

**tac**, is the inverse of _cat_, listing a file backwards from its end.

**rev**

reverses each line of a file, and outputs to stdout. This does not have the same effect as **tac**, as it preserves the order of the lines, but flips each one around (mirror image).

bash$ **cat file1.txt**
This is line 1.
 This is line 2.

bash$ **tac file1.txt**
This is line 2.
 This is line 1.

bash$ **rev file1.txt**
.1 enil si sihT
 .2 enil si sihT
	      

**cp**

This is the file copy command. **cp file1 file2** copies file1 to file2, overwriting file2 if it already exists (see [Example 16-6](#EX42)).

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

Particularly useful are the \-a archive flag (for copying an entire directory tree), the \-u update flag (which prevents overwriting identically-named newer files), and the \-r and \-R recursive flags.

cp -u source\_dir/\* dest\_dir
#  "Synchronize" dest\_dir to source\_dir
#+  by copying over all newer and not previously existing files.

**mv**

This is the file _move_ command. It is equivalent to a combination of **cp** and **rm**. It may be used to move multiple files to a directory, or even to rename a directory. For some examples of using **mv** in a script, see [Example 10-11](#RFE) and [Example A-2](#RN).

![Note](../images/note.gif)

When used in a non-interactive script, **mv** takes the \-f (_force_) option to bypass user input.

When a directory is moved to a preexisting directory, it becomes a subdirectory of the destination directory.

bash$ **mv source\_directory target\_directory**

bash$ **ls -lF target\_directory**
total 1
 drwxrwxr-x    2 bozo  bozo      1024 May 28 19:20 source\_directory/
	      

**rm**

Delete (remove) a file or files. The \-f option forces removal of even readonly files, and is useful for bypassing user input in a script.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The _rm_ command will, by itself, fail to remove filenames beginning with a dash. Why? Because _rm_ sees a dash-prefixed filename as an _option_.

bash$ **rm -badname**
rm: invalid option -- b
 Try \`rm --help' for more information.

One clever workaround is to precede the filename with a " -- " (the _end-of-options_ flag).

bash$ **rm -- -badname**

Another method to is to preface the filename to be removed with a dot-slash .

bash$ **rm ./-badname**

![Warning](../images/warning.gif)

When used with the recursive flag \-r, this command removes files all the way down the directory tree from the current directory. A careless **rm -rf \*** can wipe out a big chunk of a directory structure.

**rmdir**

Remove directory. The directory must be empty of all files -- including "invisible" _dotfiles_ [\[71\]](#FTN.AEN10228) -- for this command to succeed.

**mkdir**

Make directory, creates a new directory. For example, **mkdir -p project/programs/December** creates the named directory. The _\-p_ option automatically creates any necessary parent directories.

**chmod**

Changes the attributes of an existing file or directory (see [Example 15-14](#EX44)).

chmod +x filename
# Makes "filename" executable for all users.

chmod u+s filename
# Sets "suid" bit on "filename" permissions.
# An ordinary user may execute "filename" with same privileges as the file's owner.
# (This does not apply to shell scripts.)

chmod 644 filename
#  Makes "filename" readable/writable to owner, readable to others
#+ (octal mode).

chmod 444 filename
#  Makes "filename" read-only for all.
#  Modifying the file (for example, with a text editor)
#+ not allowed for a user who does not own the file (except for root),
#+ and even the file owner must force a file-save
#+ if she modifies the file.
#  Same restrictions apply for deleting the file.

chmod 1777 directory-name
#  Gives everyone read, write, and execute permission in directory,
#+ however also sets the "sticky bit".
#  This means that only the owner of the directory,
#+ owner of the file, and, of course, root
#+ can delete any particular file in that directory.

chmod 111 directory-name
#  Gives everyone execute-only permission in a directory.
#  This means that you can execute and READ the files in that directory
#+ (execute permission necessarily includes read permission
#+ because you can't execute a file without being able to read it).
#  But you can't list the files or search for them with the "find" command.
#  These restrictions do not apply to root.

chmod 000 directory-name
#  No permissions at all for that directory.
#  Can't read, write, or execute files in it.
#  Can't even list files in it or "cd" to it.
#  But, you can rename (mv) the directory
#+ or delete it (rmdir) if it is empty.
#  You can even symlink to files in the directory,
#+ but you can't read, write, or execute the symlinks.
#  These restrictions do not apply to root.

**chattr**

**Ch**ange file **attr**ibutes. This is analogous to **chmod** above, but with different options and a different invocation syntax, and it works only on _ext2/ext3_ filesystems.

One particularly interesting **chattr** option is i. A **chattr +i filename** marks the file as immutable. The file cannot be modified, linked to, or deleted, _not even by root_. This file attribute can be set or removed only by _root_. In a similar fashion, the a option marks the file as append only.

root# **chattr +i file1.txt**

root# **rm file1.txt**

rm: remove write-protected regular file \`file1.txt'? y
 rm: cannot remove \`file1.txt': Operation not permitted
	      

If a file has the s (secure) attribute set, then when it is deleted its block is overwritten with binary zeroes. [\[72\]](#FTN.AEN10301)

If a file has the u (undelete) attribute set, then when it is deleted, its contents can still be retrieved (undeleted).

If a file has the c (compress) attribute set, then it will automatically be compressed on writes to disk, and uncompressed on reads.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The file attributes set with **chattr** do not show in a file listing (**ls -l**).

**ln**

Creates links to pre-existings files. A "link" is a reference to a file, an alternate name for it. The **ln** command permits referencing the linked file by more than one name and is a superior alternative to aliasing (see [Example 4-6](#EX18)).

The **ln** creates only a reference, a pointer to the file only a few bytes in size.

The **ln** command is most often used with the \-s, symbolic or "soft" link flag. Advantages of using the \-s flag are that it permits linking across file systems or to directories.

The syntax of the command is a bit tricky. For example: **ln -s oldfile newfile** links the previously existing oldfile to the newly created link, newfile.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

If a file named newfile has previously existed, an error message will result.

**Which type of link to use?**

As John Macdonald explains it:

Both of these \[types of links\] provide a certain measure of dual reference -- if you edit the contents of the file using any name, your changes will affect both the original name and either a hard or soft new name. The differences between them occurs when you work at a higher level. The advantage of a hard link is that the new name is totally independent of the old name -- if you remove or rename the old name, that does not affect the hard link, which continues to point to the data while it would leave a soft link hanging pointing to the old name which is no longer there. The advantage of a soft link is that it can refer to a different file system (since it is just a reference to a file name, not to actual data). And, unlike a hard link, a symbolic link can refer to a directory.

Links give the ability to invoke a script (or any other type of executable) with multiple names, and having that script behave according to how it was invoked.

**Example 16-2. Hello or Good-bye**

#!/bin/bash
# hello.sh: Saying "hello" or "goodbye"
#+          depending on how script is invoked.

# Make a link in current working directory ($PWD) to this script:
#    ln -s hello.sh goodbye
# Now, try invoking this script both ways:
# ./hello.sh
# ./goodbye


HELLO\_CALL=65
GOODBYE\_CALL=66

if \[ $0 = "./goodbye" \]
then
  echo "Good-bye!"
  # Some other goodbye-type commands, as appropriate.
  exit $GOODBYE\_CALL
fi

echo "Hello!"
# Some other hello-type commands, as appropriate.
exit $HELLO\_CALL

**man**, **info**

These commands access the manual and information pages on system commands and installed utilities. When available, the _info_ pages usually contain more detailed descriptions than do the _man_ pages.

There have been various attempts at "automating" the writing of _man pages_. For a script that makes a tentative first step in that direction, see [Example A-39](#MANED).

* * *

16.2. Complex Commands
======================

**Commands for more advanced users**

**find**

\-exec _COMMAND_ \\;

Carries out _COMMAND_ on each file that **find** matches. The command sequence terminates with ; (the ";" is [escaped](#ESCP) to make certain the shell passes it to **find** literally, without interpreting it as a special character).

bash$ **find ~/ -name '\*.txt'**
/home/bozo/.kde/share/apps/karm/karmdata.txt
 /home/bozo/misc/irmeyc.txt
 /home/bozo/test-scripts/1.txt
	      

If _COMMAND_ contains {}, then **find** substitutes the full path name of the selected file for "{}".

find ~/ -name 'core\*' -exec rm {} \\;
# Removes all core dump files from user's home directory.

find /home/bozo/projects -mtime -1
#                               ^   Note minus sign!
#  Lists all files in /home/bozo/projects directory tree
#+ that were modified within the last day (current\_day - 1).
#
find /home/bozo/projects -mtime 1
#  Same as above, but modified \*exactly\* one day ago.
#
#  mtime = last modification time of the target file
#  ctime = last status change time (via 'chmod' or otherwise)
#  atime = last access time

DIR=/home/bozo/junk\_files
find "$DIR" -type f -atime +5 -exec rm {} \\;
#                          ^           ^^
#  Curly brackets are placeholder for the path name output by "find."
#
#  Deletes all files in "/home/bozo/junk\_files"
#+ that have not been accessed in \*at least\* 5 days (plus sign ... +5).
#
#  "-type filetype", where
#  f = regular file
#  d = directory
#  l = symbolic link, etc.
#
#  (The 'find' manpage and info page have complete option listings.)

find /etc -exec grep '\[0-9\]\[0-9\]\*\[.\]\[0-9\]\[0-9\]\*\[.\]\[0-9\]\[0-9\]\*\[.\]\[0-9\]\[0-9\]\*' {} \\;

# Finds all IP addresses (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) in /etc directory files.
# There a few extraneous hits. Can they be filtered out?

# Possibly by:

find /etc -type f -exec cat '{}' \\; | tr -c '.\[:digit:\]' '\\n' \\
| grep '^\[^.\]\[^.\]\*\\.\[^.\]\[^.\]\*\\.\[^.\]\[^.\]\*\\.\[^.\]\[^.\]\*$'
#
#  \[:digit:\] is one of the character classes
#+ introduced with the POSIX 1003.2 standard. 

# Thanks, StÃ©phane Chazelas. 

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The \-exec option to **find** should not be confused with the [exec](#EXECREF) shell builtin.

**Example 16-3. _Badname_, eliminate file names in current directory containing bad characters and [whitespace](#WHITESPACEREF).**

#!/bin/bash
# badname.sh
# Delete filenames in current directory containing bad characters.

for filename in \*
do
  badname=\`echo "$filename" | sed -n /\[\\+\\{\\;\\"\\\\\\=\\?~\\(\\)\\<\\>\\&\\\*\\|\\$\]/p\`
# badname=\`echo "$filename" | sed -n '/\[+{;"\\=?~()<>&\*|$\]/p'\`  also works.
# Deletes files containing these nasties:     + { ; " \\ = ? ~ ( ) < > & \* | $

See [Example 16-30](#EX48), [Example 3-4](#EX58), and [Example 11-10](#FINDSTRING) for scripts using **find**. Its [manpage](#MANREF) provides more detail on this complex and powerful command.

**xargs**

A filter for feeding arguments to a command, and also a tool for assembling the commands themselves. It breaks a data stream into small enough chunks for filters and commands to process. Consider it as a powerful replacement for [backquotes](#BACKQUOTESREF). In situations where [command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF) fails with a too many arguments error, substituting **xargs** often works. [\[73\]](#FTN.AEN10465) Normally, **xargs** reads from stdin or from a pipe, but it can also be given the output of a file.

The default command for **xargs** is [echo](#ECHOREF). This means that input piped to **xargs** may have linefeeds and other whitespace characters stripped out.

bash$ **ls -l**
total 0
 -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo         0 Jan 29 23:58 file1
 -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo         0 Jan 29 23:58 file2

bash$ **ls -l | xargs**
total 0 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Jan 29 23:58 file1 -rw-rw-r-- 1 bozo bozo 0 Jan...

**ls | xargs -p -l gzip** [gzips](#GZIPREF) every file in current directory, one at a time, prompting before each operation.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Note that _xargs_ processes the arguments passed to it sequentially, _one at a time_.

bash$ **find /usr/bin | xargs file**
/usr/bin:          directory
 /usr/bin/foomatic-ppd-options:          perl script text executable
 . . .
	      

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

An interesting _xargs_ option is \-n _NN_, which limits to _NN_ the number of arguments passed.

**ls | xargs -n 8 echo** lists the files in the current directory in 8 columns.

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

Another useful option is \-0, in combination with **find -print0** or **grep -lZ**. This allows handling arguments containing whitespace or quotes.

**find / -type f -print0 | xargs -0 grep -liwZ GUI | xargs -0 rm -f**

**grep -rliwZ GUI / | xargs -0 rm -f**

Either of the above will remove any file containing "GUI". _(Thanks, S.C.)_

Or:

cat /proc/"$pid"/"$OPTION" | xargs -0 echo
#  Formats output:         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#  From Han Holl's fixup of "get-commandline.sh"
#+ script in "/dev and /proc" chapter.

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

The \-P option to _xargs_ permits running processes in parallel. This speeds up execution in a machine with a multicore CPU.

#!/bin/bash

ls \*gif | xargs -t -n1 -P2 gif2png
# Converts all the gif images in current directory to png.

# Options:
# =======
# -t    Print command to stderr.
# -n1   At most 1 argument per command line.
# -P2   Run up to 2 processes simultaneously.

# Thank you, Roberto Polli, for the inspiration.

**Example 16-5. Logfile: Using _xargs_ to monitor system log**

#!/bin/bash

# Generates a log file in current directory
# from the tail end of /var/log/messages.

# Note: /var/log/messages must be world readable
# if this script invoked by an ordinary user.
#         #root chmod 644 /var/log/messages

LINES=5

( date; uname -a ) >>logfile
# Time and machine name
echo ---------------------------------------------------------- >>logfile
tail -n $LINES /var/log/messages | xargs | fmt -s >>logfile
echo >>logfile
echo >>logfile

exit 0

#  Note:
#  ----
#  As Frank Wang points out,
#+ unmatched quotes (either single or double quotes) in the source file
#+ may give xargs indigestion.
#
#  He suggests the following substitution for line 15:
#  tail -n $LINES /var/log/messages | tr -d "\\"'" | xargs | fmt -s >>logfile



#  Exercise:
#  --------
#  Modify this script to track changes in /var/log/messages at intervals
#+ of 20 minutes.
#  Hint: Use the "watch" command. 

[As in **find**](#CURLYBRACKETSREF), a curly bracket pair serves as a placeholder for replacement text.

**Example 16-6. Copying files in current directory to another**

#!/bin/bash
# copydir.sh

#  Copy (verbose) all files in current directory ($PWD)

ls . | xargs -i -t cp ./{} $1
#            ^^ ^^      ^^
#  -t is "verbose" (output command-line to stderr) option.
#  -i is "replace strings" option.
#  {} is a placeholder for output text.
#  This is similar to the use of a curly-bracket pair in "find."
#
#  List the files in current directory (ls .),
#+ pass the output of "ls" as arguments to "xargs" (-i -t options),
#+ then copy (cp) these arguments ({}) to new directory ($1).  
#
#  The net result is the exact equivalent of

exit $?

**expr**

All-purpose expression evaluator: Concatenates and evaluates the arguments according to the operation given (arguments must be separated by spaces). Operations may be arithmetic, comparison, string, or logical.

**expr 3 + 5**

returns 8

**expr 5 % 3**

returns 2

**expr 1 / 0**

returns the error message, expr: division by zero

Illegal arithmetic operations not allowed.

**expr 5 \\\* 3**

returns 15

The multiplication operator must be escaped when used in an arithmetic expression with **expr**.

**y=\`expr $y + 1\`**

Increment a variable, with the same effect as **let y=y+1** and **y=$(($y+1))**. This is an example of [arithmetic expansion](#ARITHEXPREF).

**z=\`expr substr $string $position $length\`**

Extract substring of $length characters, starting at $position.

The above script illustrates how **expr** uses the _escaped parentheses -- \\( ... \\) --_ grouping operator in tandem with [regular expression](#REGEXREF) parsing to match a substring. Here is a another example, this time from "real life."

\# Strip the whitespace from the beginning and end.

#  From Peter Knowles' "booklistgen.sh" script
#+ for converting files to Sony Librie/PRS-50X format.
#  (http://booklistgensh.peterknowles.com)

[Perl](#PERLREF), [sed](#SEDREF), and [awk](#AWKREF) have far superior string parsing facilities. A short **sed** or **awk** "subroutine" within a script (see [Section 36.2](#WRAPPER)) is an attractive alternative to **expr**.

See [Section 10.1](#STRING-MANIPULATION) for more on using **expr** in string operations.

16.3. Time / Date Commands
==========================

**Time/date and timing**

**date**

Simply invoked, **date** prints the date and time to stdout. Where this command gets interesting is in its formatting and parsing options.

**Example 16-10. Using _date_**

#!/bin/bash
# Exercising the 'date' command

echo "The number of days since the year's beginning is \`date +%j\`."
# Needs a leading '+' to invoke formatting.
# %j gives day of year.

echo "The number of seconds elapsed since 01/01/1970 is \`date +%s\`."
#  %s yields number of seconds since "UNIX epoch" began,
#+ but how is this useful?

prefix=temp
suffix=$(date +%s)  # The "+%s" option to 'date' is GNU-specific.
filename=$prefix.$suffix
echo "Temporary filename = $filename"
#  It's great for creating "unique and random" temp filenames,
#+ even better than using $$.

# Read the 'date' man page for more formatting options.

exit 0

The \-u option gives the UTC (Universal Coordinated Time).

bash$ **date**
Fri Mar 29 21:07:39 MST 2002

bash$ **date -u**
Sat Mar 30 04:07:42 UTC 2002
	      

This option facilitates calculating the time between different dates.

**Example 16-11. _Date_ calculations**

#!/bin/bash
# date-calc.sh
# Author: Nathan Coulter
# Used in ABS Guide with permission (thanks!).

MPHR=60    # Minutes per hour.
HPD=24     # Hours per day.

diff () {
        printf '%s' $(( $(date -u -d"$TARGET" +%s) -
                        $(date -u -d"$CURRENT" +%s)))
#                       %d = day of month.
}


CURRENT=$(date -u -d '2007-09-01 17:30:24' '+%F %T.%N %Z')
TARGET=$(date -u -d'2007-12-25 12:30:00' '+%F %T.%N %Z')
# %F = full date, %T = %H:%M:%S, %N = nanoseconds, %Z = time zone.

printf '\\nIn 2007, %s ' \\
       "$(date -d"$CURRENT +
        $(( $(diff) /$MPHR /$MPHR /$HPD / 2 )) days" '+%d %B')" 
#       %B = name of month                ^ halfway
printf 'was halfway between %s ' "$(date -d"$CURRENT" '+%d %B')"
printf 'and %s\\n' "$(date -d"$TARGET" '+%d %B')"

printf '\\nOn %s at %s, there were\\n' \\
        $(date -u -d"$CURRENT" +%F) $(date -u -d"$CURRENT" +%T)
DAYS=$(( $(diff) / $MPHR / $MPHR / $HPD ))
CURRENT=$(date -d"$CURRENT +$DAYS days" '+%F %T.%N %Z')
HOURS=$(( $(diff) / $MPHR / $MPHR ))
CURRENT=$(date -d"$CURRENT +$HOURS hours" '+%F %T.%N %Z')
MINUTES=$(( $(diff) / $MPHR ))
CURRENT=$(date -d"$CURRENT +$MINUTES minutes" '+%F %T.%N %Z')
printf '%s days, %s hours, ' "$DAYS" "$HOURS"
printf '%s minutes, and %s seconds ' "$MINUTES" "$(diff)"
printf 'until Christmas Dinner!\\n\\n'

#  Exercise:
#  --------
#  Rewrite the diff () function to accept passed parameters,
#+ rather than using global variables.

The _date_ command has quite a number of _output_ options. For example %N gives the nanosecond portion of the current time. One interesting use for this is to generate random integers.

date +%N | sed -e 's/000$//' -e 's/^0//'
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#  Strip off leading and trailing zeroes, if present.
#  Length of generated integer depends on
#+ how many zeroes stripped off.

# 115281032
# 63408725
# 394504284

There are many more options (try **man date**).

date +%j
# Echoes day of the year (days elapsed since January 1).

date +%k%M
# Echoes hour and minute in 24-hour format, as a single digit string.



# The 'TZ' parameter permits overriding the default time zone.
date                 # Mon Mar 28 21:42:16 MST 2005
TZ=EST date          # Mon Mar 28 23:42:16 EST 2005
# Thanks, Frank Kannemann and Pete Sjoberg, for the tip.


SixDaysAgo=$(date --date='6 days ago')
OneMonthAgo=$(date --date='1 month ago')  # Four weeks back (not a month!)
OneYearAgo=$(date --date='1 year ago')

See also [Example 3-4](#EX58) and [Example A-43](#STOPWATCH).

**zdump**

Time zone dump: echoes the time in a specified time zone.

bash$ **zdump EST**
EST  Tue Sep 18 22:09:22 2001 EST
	      

**time**

Outputs verbose timing statistics for executing a command.

**time ls -l /** gives something like this:

real    0m0.067s
 user    0m0.004s
 sys     0m0.005s

See also the very similar [times](#TIMESREF) command in the previous section.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

As of [version 2.0](#BASH2REF) of Bash, **time** became a shell reserved word, with slightly altered behavior in a pipeline.

**touch**

Utility for updating access/modification times of a file to current system time or other specified time, but also useful for creating a new file. The command **touch zzz** will create a new file of zero length, named zzz, assuming that zzz did not previously exist. Time-stamping empty files in this way is useful for storing date information, for example in keeping track of modification times on a project.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The **touch** command is equivalent to **: >> newfile** or **\>> newfile** (for ordinary files).

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

Before doing a [cp -u](#CPREF) (_copy/update_), use **touch** to update the time stamp of files you don't wish overwritten.

As an example, if the directory /home/bozo/tax\_audit contains the files spreadsheet-051606.data, spreadsheet-051706.data, and spreadsheet-051806.data, then doing a **touch spreadsheet\*.data** will protect these files from being overwritten by files with the same names during a **cp -u /home/bozo/financial\_info/spreadsheet\*data /home/bozo/tax\_audit**.

**at**

The **at** job control command executes a given set of commands at a specified time. Superficially, it resembles [cron](#CRONREF), however, **at** is chiefly useful for one-time execution of a command set.

**at 2pm January 15** prompts for a set of commands to execute at that time. These commands should be shell-script compatible, since, for all practical purposes, the user is typing in an executable shell script a line at a time. Input terminates with a [Ctl-D](#CTLDREF).

Using either the \-f option or input redirection (<), **at** reads a command list from a file. This file is an executable shell script, though it should, of course, be non-interactive. Particularly clever is including the [run-parts](#RUNPARTSREF) command in the file to execute a different set of scripts.

bash$ **at 2:30 am Friday < at-jobs.list**
job 2 at 2000-10-27 02:30
	      

**batch**

The **batch** job control command is similar to **at**, but it runs a command list when the system load drops below .8. Like **at**, it can read commands from a file with the \-f option.

The concept of _batch processing_ dates back to the era of mainframe computers. It means running a set of commands without user intervention.

**cal**

Prints a neatly formatted monthly calendar to stdout. Will do current year or a large range of past and future years.

**sleep**

This is the shell equivalent of a _wait loop_. It pauses for a specified number of seconds, doing nothing. It can be useful for timing or in processes running in the background, checking for a specific event every so often (polling), as in [Example 32-6](#ONLINE).

sleep 3     # Pauses 3 seconds.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The **sleep** command defaults to seconds, but minute, hours, or days may also be specified.

sleep 3 h   # Pauses 3 hours!

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The [watch](#WATCHREF) command may be a better choice than **sleep** for running commands at timed intervals.

**usleep**

_Microsleep_ (the _u_ may be read as the Greek _mu_, or _micro-_ prefix). This is the same as **sleep**, above, but "sleeps" in microsecond intervals. It can be used for fine-grained timing, or for polling an ongoing process at very frequent intervals.

usleep 30     # Pauses 30 microseconds.

This command is part of the Red Hat _initscripts / rc-scripts_ package.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

The **usleep** command does not provide particularly accurate timing, and is therefore unsuitable for critical timing loops.

**hwclock**, **clock**

The **hwclock** command accesses or adjusts the machine's hardware clock. Some options require _root_ privileges. The /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit startup file uses **hwclock** to set the system time from the hardware clock at bootup.

The **clock** command is a synonym for **hwclock**.

16.4. Text Processing Commands
==============================

**Commands affecting text and text files**

**sort**

File sort utility, often used as a filter in a pipe. This command sorts a _text stream_ or file forwards or backwards, or according to various keys or character positions. Using the \-m option, it merges presorted input files. The _info page_ lists its many capabilities and options. See [Example 11-10](#FINDSTRING), [Example 11-11](#SYMLINKS), and [Example A-8](#MAKEDICT).

**tsort**

_Topological sort_, reading in pairs of whitespace-separated strings and sorting according to input patterns. The original purpose of **tsort** was to sort a list of dependencies for an obsolete version of the _ld_ linker in an "ancient" version of UNIX.

The results of a _tsort_ will usually differ markedly from those of the standard **sort** command, above.

**uniq**

This filter removes duplicate lines from a sorted file. It is often seen in a pipe coupled with [sort](#SORTREF).

cat list-1 list-2 list-3 | sort | uniq > final.list
# Concatenates the list files,
# sorts them,
# removes duplicate lines,
# and finally writes the result to an output file.

The useful \-c option prefixes each line of the input file with its number of occurrences.

bash$ **cat testfile**
This line occurs only once.
 This line occurs twice.
 This line occurs twice.
 This line occurs three times.
 This line occurs three times.
 This line occurs three times.

bash$ **uniq -c testfile**
      1 This line occurs only once.
       2 This line occurs twice.
       3 This line occurs three times.

bash$ **sort testfile | uniq -c | sort -nr**
      3 This line occurs three times.
       2 This line occurs twice.
       1 This line occurs only once.
	      

The **sort INPUTFILE | uniq -c | sort -nr** command string produces a _frequency of occurrence_ listing on the INPUTFILE file (the \-nr options to **sort** cause a reverse numerical sort). This template finds use in analysis of log files and dictionary lists, and wherever the lexical structure of a document needs to be examined.

**Example 16-12. Word Frequency Analysis**

#!/bin/bash
# wf.sh: Crude word frequency analysis on a text file.
# This is a more efficient version of the "wf2.sh" script.


# Check for input file on command-line.
ARGS=1
E\_BADARGS=85
E\_NOFILE=86

if \[ $# -ne "$ARGS" \]  # Correct number of arguments passed to script?
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` filename"
  exit $E\_BADARGS
fi

if \[ ! -f "$1" \]       # Check if file exists.
then
  echo "File \\"$1\\" does not exist."
  exit $E\_NOFILE
fi

#                           =========================
#                            Frequency of occurrence

#  Filter out periods and commas, and
#+ change space between words to linefeed,

#  Arun Giridhar suggests modifying the above to:
#  . . . | sort | uniq -c | sort +1 \[-f\] | sort +0 -nr
#  This adds a secondary sort key, so instances of
#+ equal occurrence are sorted alphabetically.
#  As he explains it:
#  "This is effectively a radix sort, first on the
#+ least significant column
#+ (word or string, optionally case-insensitive)
#+ and last on the most significant column (frequency)."
#
#  As Frank Wang explains, the above is equivalent to
#+       . . . | sort | uniq -c | sort +0 -nr
#+ and the following also works:
#+       . . . | sort | uniq -c | sort -k1nr -k

# Exercises:
# ---------
# 1) Add 'sed' commands to filter out other punctuation,
#+   such as semicolons.
# 2) Modify the script to also filter out multiple spaces and
#+   other whitespace.

bash$ **cat testfile**
This line occurs only once.
 This line occurs twice.
 This line occurs twice.
 This line occurs three times.
 This line occurs three times.
 This line occurs three times.

       3 times
       3 three
       2 twice
       1 only
       1 once
	       

**expand**, **unexpand**

The **expand** filter converts tabs to spaces. It is often used in a [pipe](#PIPEREF).

The **unexpand** filter converts spaces to tabs. This reverses the effect of **expand**.

**cut**

A tool for extracting [fields](#FIELDREF) from files. It is similar to the **print $N** command set in [awk](#AWKREF), but more limited. It may be simpler to use _cut_ in a script than _awk_. Particularly important are the \-d (delimiter) and \-f (field specifier) options.

Using **cut** to obtain a listing of the mounted filesystems:

cut -d ' ' -f1,2 /etc/mtab

Using **cut** to list the OS and kernel version:

uname -a | cut -d" " -f1,3,11,12

Using **cut** to extract message headers from an e-mail folder:

bash$ **grep '^Subject:' read-messages | cut -c10-80**
Re: Linux suitable for mission-critical apps?
 MAKE MILLIONS WORKING AT HOME!!!
 Spam complaint
 Re: Spam complaint

Using **cut** to parse a file:

\# List all the users in /etc/passwd.

FILENAME=/etc/passwd

for user in $(cut -d: -f1 $FILENAME)
do
  echo $user
done

# Thanks, Oleg Philon for suggesting this.

**cut -d ' ' -f2,3 filename** is equivalent to **awk -F'\[ \]' '{ print $2, $3 }' filename**

![Note](../images/note.gif)

It is even possible to specify a linefeed as a delimiter. The trick is to actually embed a linefeed (**RETURN**) in the command sequence.

bash$ **cut -d'
 ' -f3,7,19 testfile**
This is line 3 of testfile.
 This is line 7 of testfile.
 This is line 19 of testfile.
	      

Thank you, Jaka Kranjc, for pointing this out.

See also [Example 16-48](#BASE).

**paste**

Tool for merging together different files into a single, multi-column file. In combination with [cut](#CUTREF), useful for creating system log files.

bash$ **cat items**
alphabet blocks
 building blocks
 cables

bash$ **cat prices**
$1.00/dozen
 $2.50 ea.
 $3.75

bash$ **paste items prices**
alphabet blocks $1.00/dozen
 building blocks $2.50 ea.
 cables  $3.75

**join**

Consider this a special-purpose cousin of **paste**. This powerful utility allows merging two files in a meaningful fashion, which essentially creates a simple version of a relational database.

The **join** command operates on exactly two files, but pastes together only those lines with a common tagged [field](#FIELDREF) (usually a numerical label), and writes the result to stdout. The files to be joined should be sorted according to the tagged field for the matchups to work properly.

File: 1.data

100 Shoes
200 Laces
300 Socks

File: 2.data

100 $40.00
200 $1.00
300 $2.00

bash$ **join 1.data 2.data**
File: 1.data 2.data

 100 Shoes $40.00
 200 Laces $1.00
 300 Socks $2.00
	      

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The tagged field appears only once in the output.

**head**

lists the beginning of a file to stdout. The default is 10 lines, but a different number can be specified. The command has a number of interesting options.

**Example 16-13. Which files are scripts?**

#!/bin/bash
# script-detector.sh: Detects scripts within a directory.

TESTCHARS=2    # Test first 2 characters.
SHABANG='#!'   # Scripts begin with a "sha-bang."

for file in \*  # Traverse all the files in current directory.
do
  if \[\[ \`head -c$TESTCHARS "$file"\` = "$SHABANG" \]\]
  #      head -c2                      #!
  #  The '-c' option to "head" outputs a specified
  #+ number of characters, rather than lines (the default).
  then
    echo "File \\"$file\\" is a script."
  else
    echo "File \\"$file\\" is \*not\* a script."
  fi
done
  
exit 0

#  Exercises:
#  ---------
#  1) Modify this script to take as an optional argument
#+    the directory to scan for scripts
#+    (rather than just the current working directory).
#
#  2) As it stands, this script gives "false positives" for
#+    Perl, awk, and other scripting language scripts.
#     Correct this.

**Example 16-14. Generating 10-digit random numbers**

#!/bin/bash
# rnd.sh: Outputs a 10-digit random number

# Script by Stephane Chazelas.

head -c4 /dev/urandom | od -N4 -tu4 | sed -ne '1s/.\* //p'


# =================================================================== #

# Analysis
# --------

# head:
# -c4 option takes first 4 bytes.

# od:
# -N4 option limits output to 4 bytes.
# -tu4 option selects unsigned decimal format for output.

# sed: 
# -n option, in combination with "p" flag to the "s" command,
# outputs only matched lines.



# The author of this script explains the action of 'sed', as follows.

# head -c4 /dev/urandom | od -N4 -tu4 | sed -ne '1s/.\* //p'
# ----------------------------------> |

# Assume output up to "sed" --------> |
# is 0000000 1198195154\\n

#  sed begins reading characters: 0000000 1198195154\\n.
#  Here it finds a newline character,
#+ so it is ready to process the first line (0000000 1198195154).
#  It looks at its <range><action>s. The first and only one is

#   range     action
#   1         s/.\* //p

#  The line number is in the range, so it executes the action:
#+ tries to substitute the longest string ending with a space in the line
#  ("0000000 ") with nothing (//), and if it succeeds, prints the result
#  ("p" is a flag to the "s" command here, this is different
#+ from the "p" command).

#  sed is now ready to continue reading its input. (Note that before
#+ continuing, if -n option had not been passed, sed would have printed
#+ the line once again).

#  Now, sed reads the remainder of the characters, and finds the
#+ end of the file.
#  It is now ready to process its 2nd line (which is also numbered '$' as
#+ it's the last one).
#  It sees it is not matched by any <range>, so its job is done.

#  In few word this sed commmand means:
#  "On the first line only, remove any character up to the right-most space,
#+ then print it."

# A better way to do this would have been:
#           sed -e 's/.\* //;q'

# Here, two <range><action>s (could have been written
#           sed -e 's/.\* //' -e q):

#   range                    action
#   nothing (matches line)   s/.\* //
#   nothing (matches line)   q (quit)

#  Here, sed only reads its first line of input.
#  It performs both actions, and prints the line (substituted) before
#+ quitting (because of the "q" action) since the "-n" option is not passed.

# =================================================================== #

# An even simpler altenative to the above one-line script would be:
#           head -c4 /dev/urandom| od -An -tu4

exit

See also [Example 16-39](#EX52).

**tail**

lists the (tail) end of a file to stdout. The default is 10 lines, but this can be changed with the \-n option. Commonly used to keep track of changes to a system logfile, using the \-f option, which outputs lines appended to the file.

**Example 16-15. Using _tail_ to monitor the system log**

#!/bin/bash

filename=sys.log

cat /dev/null > $filename; echo "Creating / cleaning out file."
#  Creates the file if it does not already exist,
#+ and truncates it to zero length if it does.
#  : > filename   and   > filename also work.

tail /var/log/messages > $filename  
# /var/log/messages must have world read permission for this to work.

echo "$filename contains tail end of system log."

exit 0

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

To list a specific line of a text file, [pipe](#PIPEREF) the output of **head** to **tail -n 1**. For example **head -n 8 database.txt | tail -n 1** lists the 8th line of the file database.txt.

To set a variable to a given block of a text file:

var=$(head -n $m $filename | tail -n $n)

# filename = name of file
# m = from beginning of file, number of lines to end of block
# n = number of lines to set variable to (trim from end of block)

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Newer implementations of **tail** deprecate the older **tail -$LINES filename** usage. The standard **tail -n $LINES filename** is correct.

See also [Example 16-5](#EX41), [Example 16-39](#EX52) and [Example 32-6](#ONLINE).

**grep**

A multi-purpose file search tool that uses [Regular Expressions](#REGEXREF). It was originally a command/filter in the venerable **ed** line editor: **g/re/p** -- _global - regular expression - print_.

**grep** _pattern_ \[_file_...\]

Search the target file(s) for occurrences of _pattern_, where _pattern_ may be literal text or a Regular Expression.

bash$ **grep '\[rst\]ystem.$' osinfo.txt**
The GPL governs the distribution of the Linux operating system.
	      

If no target file(s) specified, **grep** works as a filter on stdout, as in a [pipe](#PIPEREF).

bash$ **ps ax | grep clock**
765 tty1     S      0:00 xclock
 901 pts/1    S      0:00 grep clock
	      

The \-i option causes a case-insensitive search.

The \-w option matches only whole words.

The \-l option lists only the files in which matches were found, but not the matching lines.

The \-r (recursive) option searches files in the current working directory and all subdirectories below it.

The \-n option lists the matching lines, together with line numbers.

bash$ **grep -n Linux osinfo.txt**
2:This is a file containing information about Linux.
 6:The GPL governs the distribution of the Linux operating system.
	      

The \-v (or \--invert-match) option _filters out_ matches.

grep pattern1 \*.txt | grep -v pattern2

# Matches all lines in "\*.txt" files containing "pattern1",
# but \*\*\*not\*\*\* "pattern2".	      

The \-c (\--count) option gives a numerical count of matches, rather than actually listing the matches.

grep -c txt \*.sgml   # (number of occurrences of "txt" in "\*.sgml" files)


#   grep -cz .
#            ^ dot
# means count (-c) zero-separated (-z) items matching "."
# that is, non-empty ones (containing at least 1 character).
# 
printf 'a b\\nc  d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\000\\n\\000e\\000\\000\\nf' | grep -cz .     # 3
printf 'a b\\nc  d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\000\\n\\000e\\000\\000\\nf' | grep -cz '$'   # 5
printf 'a b\\nc  d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\000\\n\\000e\\000\\000\\nf' | grep -cz '^'   # 5
#
printf 'a b\\nc  d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\000\\n\\000e\\000\\000\\nf' | grep -c '$'    # 9
# By default, newline chars (\\n) separate items to match. 

# Note that the -z option is GNU "grep" specific.


# Thanks, S.C.

The \--color (or \--colour) option marks the matching string in color (on the console or in an _xterm_ window). Since _grep_ prints out each entire line containing the matching pattern, this lets you see exactly _what_ is being matched. See also the \-o option, which shows only the matching portion of the line(s).

**Example 16-16. Printing out the _From_ lines in stored e-mail messages**

#!/bin/bash
# from.sh

#  Emulates the useful 'from' utility in Solaris, BSD, etc.
#  Echoes the "From" header line in all messages
#+ in your e-mail directory.


MAILDIR=~/mail/\*               #  No quoting of variable. Why?
# Maybe check if-exists $MAILDIR:   if \[ -d $MAILDIR \] . . .
GREP\_OPTS="-H -A 5 --color"    #  Show file, plus extra context lines
                               #+ and display "From" in color.
TARGETSTR="^From"              # "From" at beginning of line.

for file in $MAILDIR           #  No quoting of variable.
do
  grep $GREP\_OPTS "$TARGETSTR" "$file"
  #    ^^^^^^^^^^              #  Again, do not quote this variable.
  echo
done

exit $?

#  You might wish to pipe the output of this script to 'more'
#+ or redirect it to a file . . .

When invoked with more than one target file given, **grep** specifies which file contains matches.

bash$ **grep Linux osinfo.txt misc.txt**
osinfo.txt:This is a file containing information about Linux.
 osinfo.txt:The GPL governs the distribution of the Linux operating system.
 misc.txt:The Linux operating system is steadily gaining in popularity.
	      

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

To force **grep** to show the filename when searching only one target file, simply give /dev/null as the second file.

bash$ **grep Linux osinfo.txt /dev/null**
osinfo.txt:This is a file containing information about Linux.
 osinfo.txt:The GPL governs the distribution of the Linux operating system.
	      

If there is a successful match, **grep** returns an [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) of 0, which makes it useful in a condition test in a script, especially in combination with the \-q option to suppress output.

SUCCESS=0                      # if grep lookup succeeds
word=Linux
filename=data.file

grep -q "$word" "$filename"    #  The "-q" option
                               #+ causes nothing to echo to stdout.
if \[ $? -eq $SUCCESS \]
# if grep -q "$word" "$filename"   can replace lines 5 - 7.
then
  echo "$word found in $filename"
else
  echo "$word not found in $filename"
fi

[Example 32-6](#ONLINE) demonstrates how to use **grep** to search for a word pattern in a system logfile.

**Example 16-17. Emulating _grep_ in a script**

#!/bin/bash
# grp.sh: Rudimentary reimplementation of grep.

  then
    echo -n "$file: "
    echo "$output"
  fi              #  sed -ne "/$1/s|^|${file}: |p"  is equivalent to above.

# Exercises:
# ---------
# 1) Add newlines to output, if more than one match in any given file.
# 2) Add features.

How can **grep** search for two (or more) separate patterns? What if you want **grep** to display all lines in a file or files that contain both "pattern1" _and_ "pattern2"?

One method is to [pipe](#PIPEREF) the result of **grep pattern1** to **grep pattern2**.

For example, given the following file:

\# Filename: tstfile

This is a sample file.
This is an ordinary text file.
This file does not contain any unusual text.
This file is not unusual.
Here is some text.

Now, let's search this file for lines containing _both_ "file" and "text" . . .

bash$ **grep file tstfile**
\# Filename: tstfile
 This is a sample file.
 This is an ordinary text file.
 This file does not contain any unusual text.
 This file is not unusual.

bash$ **grep file tstfile | grep text**
This is an ordinary text file.
 This file does not contain any unusual text.

Now, for an interesting recreational use of _grep_ . . .

**egrep** -- _extended grep_ -- is the same as **grep -E**. This uses a somewhat different, extended set of [Regular Expressions](#REGEXREF), which can make the search a bit more flexible. It also allows the boolean | (_or_) operator.

bash $ **egrep 'matches|Matches' file.txt**
Line 1 matches.
 Line 3 Matches.
 Line 4 contains matches, but also Matches
              

**fgrep** -- _fast grep_ -- is the same as **grep -F**. It does a literal string search (no [Regular Expressions](#REGEXREF)), which generally speeds things up a bit.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

On some Linux distros, **egrep** and **fgrep** are symbolic links to, or aliases for **grep**, but invoked with the \-E and \-F options, respectively.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

See also [Example A-41](#QKY) for an example of speedy _fgrep_ lookup on a large text file.

**agrep** (_approximate grep_) extends the capabilities of **grep** to approximate matching. The search string may differ by a specified number of characters from the resulting matches. This utility is not part of the core Linux distribution.

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

To search compressed files, use **zgrep**, **zegrep**, or **zfgrep**. These also work on non-compressed files, though slower than plain **grep**, **egrep**, **fgrep**. They are handy for searching through a mixed set of files, some compressed, some not.

To search [bzipped](#BZIPREF) files, use **bzgrep**.

**look**

The command **look** works like **grep**, but does a lookup on a "dictionary," a sorted word list. By default, **look** searches for a match in /usr/dict/words, but a different dictionary file may be specified.

**Example 16-20. Checking words in a list for validity**

#!/bin/bash
# lookup: Does a dictionary lookup on each word in a data file.

file=words.data  # Data file from which to read words to test.

echo
echo "Testing file $file"
echo

while \[ "$word" != end \]  # Last word in data file.
do               # ^^^
  read word      # From data file, because of redirection at end of loop.
  look $word > /dev/null  # Don't want to display lines in dictionary file.
  #  Searches for words in the file /usr/share/dict/words
  #+ (usually a link to linux.words).
  lookup=$?      # Exit status of 'look' command.

  if \[ "$lookup" -eq 0 \]
  then
    echo "\\"$word\\" is valid."
  else
    echo "\\"$word\\" is invalid."
  fi  

done <"$file"    # Redirects stdin to $file, so "reads" come from there.

echo

exit 0

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Code below line will not execute because of "exit" command above.


# Stephane Chazelas proposes the following, more concise alternative:

while read word && \[\[ $word != end \]\]
do if look "$word" > /dev/null
   then echo "\\"$word\\" is valid."
   else echo "\\"$word\\" is invalid."
   fi
done <"$file"

exit 0

**sed**, **awk**

Scripting languages especially suited for parsing text files and command output. May be embedded singly or in combination in pipes and shell scripts.

**[sed](#SEDREF)**

Non-interactive "stream editor", permits using many **ex** commands in [batch](#BATCHPROCREF) mode. It finds many uses in shell scripts.

**[awk](#AWKREF)**

Programmable file extractor and formatter, good for manipulating and/or extracting [fields](#FIELDREF) (columns) in structured text files. Its syntax is similar to C.

**wc**

_wc_ gives a "word count" on a file or I/O stream:

bash $ **wc /usr/share/doc/sed-4.1.2/README**
13  70  447 README
\[13 lines  70 words  447 characters\]

**wc -w** gives only the word count.

**wc -l** gives only the line count.

**wc -c** gives only the byte count.

**wc -m** gives only the character count.

**wc -L** gives only the length of the longest line.

Using **wc** to count how many .txt files are in current working directory:

$ ls \*.txt | wc -l
#  Will work as long as none of the "\*.txt" files
#+ have a linefeed embedded in their name.

#  Alternative ways of doing this are:
#      find . -maxdepth 1 -name \\\*.txt -print0 | grep -cz .
#      (shopt -s nullglob; set -- \*.txt; echo $#)

#  Thanks, S.C.

Using **wc** to total up the size of all the files whose names begin with letters in the range d - h

bash$ **wc \[d-h\]\* | grep total | awk '{print $3}'**
71832
	      

Using **wc** to count the instances of the word "Linux" in the main source file for this book.

bash$ **grep Linux abs-book.sgml | wc -l**
138
	      

See also [Example 16-39](#EX52) and [Example 20-8](#REDIR4).

Certain commands include some of the functionality of **wc** as options.

... | grep foo | wc -l
# This frequently used construct can be more concisely rendered.

... | grep -c foo
# Just use the "-c" (or "--count") option of grep.

# Thanks, S.C.

**tr**

character translation filter.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

[Must use quoting and/or brackets](#UCREF), as appropriate. Quotes prevent the shell from reinterpreting the special characters in **tr** command sequences. Brackets should be quoted to prevent expansion by the shell.

Either **tr "A-Z" "\*" <filename** or **tr A-Z \\\* <filename** changes all the uppercase letters in filename to asterisks (writes to stdout). On some systems this may not work, but **tr A-Z '\[\*\*\]'** will.

The \-d option deletes a range of characters.

echo "abcdef"                 # abcdef
echo "abcdef" | tr -d b-d     # aef


tr -d 0-9 <filename
# Deletes all digits from the file "filename".

The \--squeeze-repeats (or \-s) option deletes all but the first instance of a string of consecutive characters. This option is useful for removing excess [whitespace](#WHITESPACEREF).

bash$ **echo "XXXXX" | tr --squeeze-repeats 'X'**
X

The \-c "complement" option _inverts_ the character set to match. With this option, **tr** acts only upon those characters _not_ matching the specified set.

bash$ **echo "acfdeb123" | tr -c b-d +**
+c+d+b++++

Note that **tr** recognizes [POSIX character classes](#POSIXREF). [\[74\]](#FTN.AEN11502)

bash$ **echo "abcd2ef1" | tr '\[:alpha:\]' -**
\----2--1
	      

**Example 16-21. _toupper_: Transforms a file to all uppercase.**

#!/bin/bash
# Changes a file to all uppercase.

E\_BADARGS=85

if \[ -z "$1" \]  # Standard check for command-line arg.
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` filename"
  exit $E\_BADARGS
fi  

tr a-z A-Z <"$1"

# Same effect as above, but using POSIX character set notation:
#        tr '\[:lower:\]' '\[:upper:\]' <"$1"
# Thanks, S.C.

#     Or even . . .
#     cat "$1" | tr a-z A-Z
#     Or dozens of other ways . . .

exit 0

#  Exercise:
#  Rewrite this script to give the option of changing a file
#+ to \*either\* upper or lowercase.
#  Hint: Use either the "case" or "select" command.

**Example 16-22. _lowercase_: Changes all filenames in working directory to lowercase.**

#!/bin/bash
#
#  Changes every filename in working directory to all lowercase.
#
#  Inspired by a script of John Dubois,
#+ which was translated into Bash by Chet Ramey,
#+ and considerably simplified by the author of the ABS Guide.


for filename in \*                # Traverse all files in directory.
do
   fname=\`basename $filename\`
   n=\`echo $fname | tr A-Z a-z\`  # Change name to lowercase.
   if \[ "$fname" != "$n" \]       # Rename only files not already lowercase.
   then
     mv $fname $n
   fi  
done   

exit $?


# Code below this line will not execute because of "exit".
#--------------------------------------------------------#
# To run it, delete script above line.

# The above script will not work on filenames containing blanks or newlines.
# Stephane Chazelas therefore suggests the following alternative:


for filename in \*    # Not necessary to use basename,
                     # since "\*" won't return any file containing "/".
do n=\`echo "$filename/" | tr '\[:upper:\]' '\[:lower:\]'\`
#                             POSIX char set notation.
#                    Slash added so that trailing newlines are not
#                    removed by command substitution.
   # Variable substitution:
   n=${n%/}          # Removes trailing slash, added above, from filename.
   \[\[ $filename == $n \]\] || mv "$filename" "$n"
                     # Checks if filename already lowercase.
done

# or     ./rot13.sh <filename
# or     ./rot13.sh and supply keyboard input (stdin)

cat "$@" | tr 'a-zA-Z' 'n-za-mN-ZA-M'   # "a" goes to "n", "b" to "o" ...
#  The   cat "$@"   construct
#+ permits input either from stdin or from files.

exit 0

**Example 16-25. Generating "Crypto-Quote" Puzzles**

#!/bin/bash
# crypto-quote.sh: Encrypt quotes

#  Will encrypt famous quotes in a simple monoalphabetic substitution.
#  The result is similar to the "Crypto Quote" puzzles
#+ seen in the Op Ed pages of the Sunday paper.


key=ETAOINSHRDLUBCFGJMQPVWZYXK
# The "key" is nothing more than a scrambled alphabet.
# Changing the "key" changes the encryption.

# The 'cat "$@"' construction gets input either from stdin or from files.
# If using stdin, terminate input with a Control-D.
# Otherwise, specify filename as command-line parameter.

cat "$@" | tr "a-z" "A-Z" | tr "A-Z" "$key"
#        |  to uppercase  |     encrypt       
# Will work on lowercase, uppercase, or mixed-case quotes.
# Passes non-alphabetic characters through unchanged.


# Try this script with something like:
# "Nothing so needs reforming as other people's habits."
# --Mark Twain
#
# Output is:
# "CFPHRCS QF CIIOQ MINFMBRCS EQ FPHIM GIFGUI'Q HETRPQ."
# --BEML PZERC

**_tr_ variants**

The **tr** utility has two historic variants. The BSD version does not use brackets (**tr a-z A-Z**), but the SysV one does (**tr '\[a-z\]' '\[A-Z\]'**). The GNU version of **tr** resembles the BSD one.

**fold**

A filter that wraps lines of input to a specified width. This is especially useful with the \-s option, which breaks lines at word spaces (see [Example 16-26](#EX50) and [Example A-1](#MAILFORMAT)).

**fmt**

Simple-minded file formatter, used as a filter in a pipe to "wrap" long lines of text output.

**Example 16-26. Formatted file listing.**

#!/bin/bash

WIDTH=40                    # 40 columns wide.

b=\`ls /usr/local/bin\`       # Get a file listing...

echo $b | fmt -w $WIDTH

# Could also have been done by
#    echo $b | fold - -s -w $WIDTH
 
exit 0

See also [Example 16-5](#EX41).

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

A powerful alternative to **fmt** is Kamil Toman's **par** utility, available from [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~amc/Par/](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~amc/Par/).

**col**

This deceptively named filter removes reverse line feeds from an input stream. It also attempts to replace whitespace with equivalent tabs. The chief use of **col** is in filtering the output from certain text processing utilities, such as **groff** and **tbl**.

**column**

Column formatter. This filter transforms list-type text output into a "pretty-printed" table by inserting tabs at appropriate places.

**Example 16-27. Using _column_ to format a directory listing**

#!/bin/bash
# colms.sh
# A minor modification of the example file in the "column" man page.


(printf "PERMISSIONS LINKS OWNER GROUP SIZE MONTH DAY HH:MM PROG-NAME\\n" \\
; ls -l | sed 1d) | column -t
#         ^^^^^^           ^^

#  The "sed 1d" in the pipe deletes the first line of output,
#+ which would be "total        N",
#+ where "N" is the total number of files found by "ls -l".

# The -t option to "column" pretty-prints a table.

exit 0

**colrm**

Column removal filter. This removes columns (characters) from a file and writes the file, lacking the range of specified columns, back to stdout. **colrm 2 4 <filename** removes the second through fourth characters from each line of the text file filename.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

If the file contains tabs or nonprintable characters, this may cause unpredictable behavior. In such cases, consider using [expand](#EXPANDREF) and **unexpand** in a pipe preceding **colrm**.

**nl**

Line numbering filter: **nl filename** lists filename to stdout, but inserts consecutive numbers at the beginning of each non-blank line. If filename omitted, operates on stdin.

The output of **nl** is very similar to **cat -b**, since, by default **nl** does not list blank lines.

**Example 16-28. _nl_: A self-numbering script.**

#!/bin/bash
# line-number.sh

# This script echoes itself twice to stdout with its lines numbered.

echo "     line number = $LINENO" # 'nl' sees this as line 4
#                                   (nl does not number blank lines).
#                                   'cat -n' sees it correctly as line #6.

nl \`basename $0\`

echo; echo  # Now, let's try it with 'cat -n'

cat -n \`basename $0\`
# The difference is that 'cat -n' numbers the blank lines.
# Note that 'nl -ba' will also do so.

exit 0
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

**pr**

Print formatting filter. This will paginate files (or stdout) into sections suitable for hard copy printing or viewing on screen. Various options permit row and column manipulation, joining lines, setting margins, numbering lines, adding page headers, and merging files, among other things. The **pr** command combines much of the functionality of **nl**, **paste**, **fold**, **column**, and **expand**.

**pr -o 5 --width=65 fileZZZ | more** gives a nice paginated listing to screen of fileZZZ with margins set at 5 and 65.

A particularly useful option is \-d, forcing double-spacing (same effect as **sed -G**).

**gettext**

The GNU **gettext** package is a set of utilities for [localizing](#LOCALIZATION) and translating the text output of programs into foreign languages. While originally intended for C programs, it now supports quite a number of programming and scripting languages.

The **gettext** _program_ works on shell scripts. See the _info page_.

**msgfmt**

A program for generating binary message catalogs. It is used for [localization](#LOCALIZATION).

**iconv**

A utility for converting file(s) to a different encoding (character set). Its chief use is for [localization](#LOCALIZATION).

\# Convert a string from UTF-8 to UTF-16 and print to the BookList
function write\_utf8\_string {
    STRING=$1
    BOOKLIST=$2
    echo -n "$STRING" | iconv -f UTF8 -t UTF16 | \\
    cut -b 3- | tr -d \\\\n >> "$BOOKLIST"
}

#  From Peter Knowles' "booklistgen.sh" script
#+ for converting files to Sony Librie/PRS-50X format.
#  (http://booklistgensh.peterknowles.com)

**recode**

Consider this a fancier version of **iconv**, above. This very versatile utility for converting a file to a different encoding scheme. Note that _recode_ is not part of the standard Linux installation.

**TeX**, **gs**

**TeX** and **Postscript** are text markup languages used for preparing copy for printing or formatted video display.

**TeX** is Donald Knuth's elaborate typsetting system. It is often convenient to write a shell script encapsulating all the options and arguments passed to one of these markup languages.

_Ghostscript_ (**gs**) is a GPL-ed Postscript interpreter.

**texexec**

Utility for processing _TeX_ and _pdf_ files. Found in /usr/bin on many Linux distros, it is actually a [shell wrapper](#SHWRAPPER) that calls [Perl](#PERLREF) to invoke _Tex_.

texexec --pdfarrange --result=Concatenated.pdf \*pdf

#  Concatenates all the pdf files in the current working directory
#+ into the merged file, Concatenated.pdf . . .
#  (The --pdfarrange option repaginates a pdf file. See also --pdfcombine.)
#  The above command-line could be parameterized and put into a shell script.

**enscript**

Utility for converting plain text file to PostScript

For example, **enscript filename.txt -p filename.ps** produces the PostScript output file filename.ps.

**groff**, **tbl**, **eqn**

Yet another text markup and display formatting language is **groff**. This is the enhanced GNU version of the venerable UNIX **roff/troff** display and typesetting package. [Manpages](#MANREF) use **groff**.

The **tbl** table processing utility is considered part of **groff**, as its function is to convert table markup into **groff** commands.

The **eqn** equation processing utility is likewise part of **groff**, and its function is to convert equation markup into **groff** commands.

**Example 16-29. _manview_: Viewing formatted manpages**

#!/bin/bash
# manview.sh: Formats the source of a man page for viewing.

#  This script is useful when writing man page source.
#  It lets you look at the intermediate results on the fly
#+ while working on it.

**lex**, **yacc**

The **lex** lexical analyzer produces programs for pattern matching. This has been replaced by the nonproprietary **flex** on Linux systems.

The **yacc** utility creates a parser based on a set of specifications. This has been replaced by the nonproprietary **bison** on Linux systems.

16.5. File and Archiving Commands
=================================

**Archiving**

**tar**

The standard UNIX archiving utility. [\[75\]](#FTN.AEN11885) Originally a _Tape ARchiving_ program, it has developed into a general purpose package that can handle all manner of archiving with all types of destination devices, ranging from tape drives to regular files to even stdout (see [Example 3-4](#EX58)). GNU _tar_ has been patched to accept various compression filters, for example: **tar czvf archive\_name.tar.gz \***, which recursively archives and [gzips](#GZIPREF) all files in a directory tree except [dotfiles](#DOTFILESREF) in the current working directory ([$PWD](#PWDREF)). [\[76\]](#FTN.AEN11896)

Some useful **tar** options:

1.  \-c create (a new archive)
    
2.  \-x extract (files from existing archive)
    
3.  \--delete delete (files from existing archive)
    
    ![Caution](../images/caution.gif)
    
    This option will not work on magnetic tape devices.
    
4.  \-r append (files to existing archive)
    
5.  \-A append (_tar_ files to existing archive)
    
6.  \-t list (contents of existing archive)
    
7.  \-u update archive
    
8.  \-d compare archive with specified filesystem
    
9.  \--after-date only process files with a date stamp _after_ specified date
    
10.  \-z [gzip](#GZIPREF) the archive
    
    (compress or uncompress, depending on whether combined with the \-c or \-x) option
    
11.  \-j [bzip2](#BZIPREF) the archive
    

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

It may be difficult to recover data from a corrupted _gzipped_ tar archive. When archiving important files, make multiple backups.

**shar**

_Shell archiving_ utility. The text and/or binary files in a shell archive are concatenated without compression, and the resultant archive is essentially a shell script, complete with #!/bin/sh header, containing all the necessary unarchiving commands, as well as the files themselves. Unprintable binary characters in the target file(s) are converted to printable ASCII characters in the output _shar_ file. _Shar archives_ still show up in Usenet newsgroups, but otherwise **shar** has been replaced by **tar**/**gzip**. The **unshar** command unpacks _shar_ archives.

The **mailshar** command is a Bash script that uses **shar** to concatenate multiple files into a single one for e-mailing. This script supports compression and [uuencoding](#UUENCODEREF).

**ar**

Creation and manipulation utility for archives, mainly used for binary object file libraries.

**rpm**

The _Red Hat Package Manager_, or **rpm** utility provides a wrapper for source or binary archives. It includes commands for installing and checking the integrity of packages, among other things.

A simple **rpm -i package\_name.rpm** usually suffices to install a package, though there are many more options available.

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

**rpm -qf** identifies which package a file originates from.

bash$ **rpm -qf /bin/ls**
coreutils-5.2.1-31
	      

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

**rpm -qa** gives a complete list of all installed _rpm_ packages on a given system. An **rpm -qa package\_name** lists only the package(s) corresponding to package\_name.

bash$ **rpm -qa**
redhat-logos-1.1.3-1
 glibc-2.2.4-13
 cracklib-2.7-12
 dosfstools-2.7-1
 gdbm-1.8.0-10
 ksymoops-2.4.1-1
 mktemp-1.5-11
 perl-5.6.0-17
 reiserfs-utils-3.x.0j-2
 ...

bash$ **rpm -qa docbook-utils**
docbook-utils-0.6.9-2

bash$ **rpm -qa docbook | grep docbook**
docbook-dtd31-sgml-1.0-10
 docbook-style-dsssl-1.64-3
 docbook-dtd30-sgml-1.0-10
 docbook-dtd40-sgml-1.0-11
 docbook-utils-pdf-0.6.9-2
 docbook-dtd41-sgml-1.0-10
 docbook-utils-0.6.9-2
	      

**cpio**

This specialized archiving copy command (**c**o**p**y **i**nput and **o**utput) is rarely seen any more, having been supplanted by **tar**/**gzip**. It still has its uses, such as moving a directory tree. With an appropriate block size (for copying) specified, it can be appreciably faster than **tar**.

**Example 16-30. Using _cpio_ to move a directory tree**

#!/bin/bash

# Copying a directory tree using cpio.

# Advantages of using 'cpio':
#   Speed of copying. It's faster than 'tar' with pipes.
#   Well suited for copying special files (named pipes, etc.)
#+  that 'cp' may choke on.

exit $?

**rpm2cpio**

This command extracts a **cpio** archive from an [rpm](#RPMREF) one.

**Example 16-31. Unpacking an _rpm_ archive**

#!/bin/bash
# de-rpm.sh: Unpack an 'rpm' archive

: ${1?"Usage: \`basename $0\` target-file"}
# Must specify 'rpm' archive name as an argument.


TEMPFILE=$$.cpio                         #  Tempfile with "unique" name.
                                         #  $$ is process ID of script.

rpm2cpio < $1 > $TEMPFILE                #  Converts rpm archive into
                                         #+ cpio archive.
cpio --make-directories -F $TEMPFILE -i  #  Unpacks cpio archive.
rm -f $TEMPFILE                          #  Deletes cpio archive.

exit 0

#  Exercise:
#  Add check for whether 1) "target-file" exists and
#+                       2) it is an rpm archive.
#  Hint:                    Parse output of 'file' command.

**pax**

The _pax_ **p**ortable **a**rchive e**x**change toolkit facilitates periodic file backups and is designed to be cross-compatible between various flavors of UNIX. It was designed to replace [tar](#TARREF) and [cpio](#CPIOREF).

pax -wf daily\_backup.pax ~/linux-server/files 
#  Creates a tar archive of all files in the target directory.
#  Note that the options to pax must be in the correct order --
#+ pax -fw     has an entirely different effect.

pax -f daily\_backup.pax
#  Lists the files in the archive.

pax -rf daily\_backup.pax ~/bsd-server/files
#  Restores the backed-up files from the Linux machine
#+ onto a BSD one.

Note that _pax_ handles many of the standard archiving and compression commands.

**Compression**

**gzip**

The standard GNU/UNIX compression utility, replacing the inferior and proprietary **compress**. The corresponding decompression command is **gunzip**, which is the equivalent of **gzip -d**.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The \-c option sends the output of **gzip** to stdout. This is useful when [piping](#PIPEREF) to other commands.

The **zcat** filter decompresses a _gzipped_ file to stdout, as possible input to a pipe or redirection. This is, in effect, a **cat** command that works on compressed files (including files processed with the older [compress](#COMPRESSREF) utility). The **zcat** command is equivalent to **gzip -dc**.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

On some commercial UNIX systems, **zcat** is a synonym for **uncompress -c**, and will not work on _gzipped_ files.

See also [Example 7-7](#EX14).

**bzip2**

An alternate compression utility, usually more efficient (but slower) than **gzip**, especially on large files. The corresponding decompression command is **bunzip2**.

Similar to the **zcat** command, **bzcat** decompresses a _bzipped2-ed_ file to stdout.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Newer versions of [tar](#TARREF) have been patched with **bzip2** support.

**compress**, **uncompress**

This is an older, proprietary compression utility found in commercial UNIX distributions. The more efficient **gzip** has largely replaced it. Linux distributions generally include a **compress** workalike for compatibility, although **gunzip** can unarchive files treated with **compress**.

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

The **znew** command transforms _compressed_ files into _gzipped_ ones.

**sq**

Yet another compression (**sq**ueeze) utility, a filter that works only on sorted [ASCII](#ASCIIDEF) word lists. It uses the standard invocation syntax for a filter, **sq < input-file > output-file**. Fast, but not nearly as efficient as [gzip](#GZIPREF). The corresponding uncompression filter is **unsq**, invoked like **sq**.

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

The output of **sq** may be piped to **gzip** for further compression.

**zip**, **unzip**

Cross-platform file archiving and compression utility compatible with DOS _pkzip.exe_. "Zipped" archives seem to be a more common medium of file exchange on the Internet than "tarballs."

**unarc**, **unarj**, **unrar**

These Linux utilities permit unpacking archives compressed with the DOS _arc.exe_, _arj.exe_, and _rar.exe_ programs.

**lzma**, **unlzma**, **lzcat**

Highly efficient Lempel-Ziv-Markov compression. The syntax of _lzma_ is similar to that of _gzip_. The [7-zip Website](http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html) has more information.

**xz**, **unxz**, **xzcat**

A new high-efficiency compression tool, backward compatible with _lzma_, and with an invocation syntax similar to _gzip_. For more information, see the [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xz).

**File Information**

**file**

A utility for identifying file types. The command **file file-name** will return a file specification for file-name, such as ascii text or data. It references the [magic numbers](#MAGNUMREF) found in /usr/share/magic, /etc/magic, or /usr/lib/magic, depending on the Linux/UNIX distribution.

The \-f option causes **file** to run in [batch](#BATCHPROCREF) mode, to read from a designated file a list of filenames to analyze. The \-z option, when used on a compressed target file, forces an attempt to analyze the uncompressed file type.

exit 0

**which**

**which command** gives the full path to "command." This is useful for finding out whether a particular command or utility is installed on the system.

**$bash which rm**

/usr/bin/rm

For an interesting use of this command, see [Example 36-16](#HORSERACE).

**whereis**

Similar to **which**, above, **whereis command** gives the full path to "command," but also to its [manpage](#MANREF).

**$bash whereis rm**

rm: /bin/rm /usr/share/man/man1/rm.1.bz2

**whatis**

**whatis command** looks up "command" in the _whatis_ database. This is useful for identifying system commands and important configuration files. Consider it a simplified **man** command.

**$bash whatis whatis**

whatis               (1)  - search the whatis database for complete words

**Example 16-33. Exploring /usr/X11R6/bin**

#!/bin/bash

# What are all those mysterious binaries in /usr/X11R6/bin?

DIRECTORY="/usr/X11R6/bin"
# Try also "/bin", "/usr/bin", "/usr/local/bin", etc.

for file in $DIRECTORY/\*
do
  whatis \`basename $file\`   # Echoes info about the binary.
done

exit 0

#  Note: For this to work, you must create a "whatis" database
#+ with /usr/sbin/makewhatis.
#  You may wish to redirect output of this script, like so:
#    ./what.sh >>whatis.db
#  or view it a page at a time on stdout,
#    ./what.sh | less

See also [Example 11-3](#FILEINFO).

**vdir**

Show a detailed directory listing. The effect is similar to [ls -lb](#LSREF).

This is one of the GNU _fileutils_.

bash$ **vdir**

**locate**, **slocate**

The **locate** command searches for files using a database stored for just that purpose. The **slocate** command is the secure version of **locate** (which may be aliased to **slocate**).

**$bash locate hickson**

/usr/lib/xephem/catalogs/hickson.edb

**getfacl**, **setfacl**

These commands _retrieve_ or _set_ the **f**ile **a**ccess **c**ontrol **l**ist -- the _owner_, _group_, and file permissions.

bash$ **getfacl \***
\# file: test1.txt
 # owner: bozo
 # group: bozgrp

**readlink**

Disclose the file that a symbolic link points to.

bash$ **readlink /usr/bin/awk**
../../bin/gawk
	      

**strings**

Use the **strings** command to find printable strings in a binary or data file. It will list sequences of printable characters found in the target file. This might be handy for a quick 'n dirty examination of a core dump or for looking at an unknown graphic image file (**strings image-file | more** might show something like _JFIF_, which would identify the file as a _jpeg_ graphic). In a script, you would probably parse the output of **strings** with [grep](#GREPREF) or [sed](#SEDREF). See [Example 11-8](#BINGREP) and [Example 11-10](#FINDSTRING).

**Example 16-34. An "improved" _strings_ command**

#!/bin/bash
# wstrings.sh: "word-strings" (enhanced "strings" command)
#
#  This script filters the output of "strings" by checking it
#+ against a standard word list file.
#  This effectively eliminates gibberish and noise,
#+ and outputs only recognized words.

MINSTRLEN=3                           #  Minimum string length.
WORDFILE=/usr/share/dict/linux.words  #  Dictionary file.
#  May specify a different word list file

       tr -cs '\[:alpha:\]' Z | tr -s '\\173-\\377' Z | tr Z ' '\`

# Translate output of 'strings' command with multiple passes of 'tr'.
#  "tr A-Z a-z"  converts to lowercase.
#  "tr '\[:space:\]'"  converts whitespace characters to Z's.
#  "tr -cs '\[:alpha:\]' Z"  converts non-alphabetic characters to Z's,
#+ and squeezes multiple consecutive Z's.
#  "tr -s '\\173-\\377' Z"  converts all characters past 'z' to Z's
#+ and squeezes multiple consecutive Z's,
#+ which gets rid of all the weird characters that the previous
#+ translation failed to deal with.
#  Finally, "tr Z ' '" converts all those Z's to whitespace,
#+ which will be seen as word separators in the loop below.

done  

exit $?

**Comparison**

**diff**, **patch**

**diff**: flexible file comparison utility. It compares the target files line-by-line sequentially. In some applications, such as comparing word dictionaries, it may be helpful to filter the files through [sort](#SORTREF) and **uniq** before piping them to **diff**. **diff file-1 file-2** outputs the lines in the files that differ, with carets showing which file each particular line belongs to.

The \--side-by-side option to **diff** outputs each compared file, line by line, in separate columns, with non-matching lines marked. The \-c and \-u options likewise make the output of the command easier to interpret.

There are available various fancy frontends for **diff**, such as **sdiff**, **wdiff**, **xdiff**, and **mgdiff**.

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

The **diff** command returns an exit status of 0 if the compared files are identical, and 1 if they differ (or 2 when _binary_ files are being compared). This permits use of **diff** in a test construct within a shell script (see below).

A common use for **diff** is generating difference files to be used with **patch** The \-e option outputs files suitable for **ed** or **ex** scripts.

**patch**: flexible versioning utility. Given a difference file generated by **diff**, **patch** can upgrade a previous version of a package to a newer version. It is much more convenient to distribute a relatively small "diff" file than the entire body of a newly revised package. Kernel "patches" have become the preferred method of distributing the frequent releases of the Linux kernel.

patch -p1 <patch-file
# Takes all the changes listed in 'patch-file'
# and applies them to the files referenced therein.
# This upgrades to a newer version of the package.

Patching the kernel:

cd /usr/src
gzip -cd patchXX.gz | patch -p0
# Upgrading kernel source using 'patch'.
# From the Linux kernel docs "README",
# by anonymous author (Alan Cox?).

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The **diff** command can also recursively compare directories (for the filenames present).

bash$ **diff -r ~/notes1 ~/notes2**
Only in /home/bozo/notes1: file02
 Only in /home/bozo/notes1: file03
 Only in /home/bozo/notes2: file04
	      

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

Use **zdiff** to compare _gzipped_ files.

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

Use **diffstat** to create a histogram (point-distribution graph) of output from **diff**.

**diff3**, **merge**

An extended version of **diff** that compares three files at a time. This command returns an exit value of 0 upon successful execution, but unfortunately this gives no information about the results of the comparison.

bash$ **diff3 file-1 file-2 file-3**
\====
 1:1c
   This is line 1 of "file-1".
 2:1c
   This is line 1 of "file-2".
 3:1c
   This is line 1 of "file-3"
	      

The **merge** (3-way file merge) command is an interesting adjunct to _diff3_. Its syntax is **merge Mergefile file1 file2**. The result is to output to Mergefile the changes that lead from file1 to file2. Consider this command a stripped-down version of _patch_.

**sdiff**

Compare and/or edit two files in order to merge them into an output file. Because of its interactive nature, this command would find little use in a script.

**cmp**

The **cmp** command is a simpler version of **diff**, above. Whereas **diff** reports the differences between two files, **cmp** merely shows at what point they differ.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Like **diff**, **cmp** returns an exit status of 0 if the compared files are identical, and 1 if they differ. This permits use in a test construct within a shell script.

**Example 16-35. Using _cmp_ to compare two files within a script.**

#!/bin/bash
# file-comparison.sh

ARGS=2  # Two args to script expected.
E\_BADARGS=85
E\_UNREADABLE=86

if \[ $# -ne "$ARGS" \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` file1 file2"
  exit $E\_BADARGS
fi

if \[\[ ! -r "$1" || ! -r "$2" \]\]
then
  echo "Both files to be compared must exist and be readable."
  exit $E\_UNREADABLE
fi

cmp $1 $2 &> /dev/null
#   Redirection to /dev/null buries the output of the "cmp" command.
#   cmp -s $1 $2  has same result ("-s" silent flag to "cmp")
#   Thank you  Anders Gustavsson for pointing this out.
#
#  Also works with 'diff', i.e.,
#+ diff $1 $2 &> /dev/null

if \[ $? -eq 0 \]         # Test exit status of "cmp" command.
then
  echo "File \\"$1\\" is identical to file \\"$2\\"."
else  
  echo "File \\"$1\\" differs from file \\"$2\\"."
fi

exit 0

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

Use **zcmp** on _gzipped_ files.

**comm**

Versatile file comparison utility. The files must be sorted for this to be useful.

**comm _\-options_ _first-file_ _second-file_**

**comm file-1 file-2** outputs three columns:

*   column 1 = lines unique to file-1
    
*   column 2 = lines unique to file-2
    
*   column 3 = lines common to both.
    

The options allow suppressing output of one or more columns.

*   \-1 suppresses column 1
    
*   \-2 suppresses column 2
    
*   \-3 suppresses column 3
    
*   \-12 suppresses both columns 1 and 2, etc.
    

This command is useful for comparing "dictionaries" or _word lists_ -- sorted text files with one word per line.

**Utilities**

**basename**

Strips the path information from a file name, printing only the file name. The construction **basename $0** lets the script know its name, that is, the name it was invoked by. This can be used for "usage" messages if, for example a script is called with missing arguments:

echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` arg1 arg2 ... argn"

**dirname**

Strips the **basename** from a filename, printing only the path information.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

**basename** and **dirname** can operate on any arbitrary string. The argument does not need to refer to an existing file, or even be a filename for that matter (see [Example A-7](#DAYSBETWEEN)).

**Example 16-36. _basename_ and _dirname_**

#!/bin/bash

address=/home/bozo/daily-journal.txt

echo "Basename of /home/bozo/daily-journal.txt = \`basename $address\`"
echo "Dirname of /home/bozo/daily-journal.txt = \`dirname $address\`"
echo
echo "My own home is \`basename ~/\`."         # \`basename ~\` also works.
echo "The home of my home is \`dirname ~/\`."  # \`dirname ~\`  also works.

exit 0

**split**, **csplit**

These are utilities for splitting a file into smaller chunks. Their usual use is for splitting up large files in order to back them up on floppies or preparatory to e-mailing or uploading them.

The **csplit** command splits a file according to _context_, the split occuring where patterns are matched.

**Example 16-37. A script that copies itself in sections**

#!/bin/bash
# splitcopy.sh

#  A script that splits itself into chunks,
#+ then reassembles the chunks into an exact copy
#+ of the original script.

CHUNKSIZE=4    #  Size of first chunk of split files.
OUTPREFIX=xx   #  csplit prefixes, by default,
               #+ files with "xx" ...

csplit "$0" "$CHUNKSIZE"

# Some comment lines for padding . . .
# Line 15
# Line 16
# Line 17
# Line 18
# Line 19
# Line 20

cat "$OUTPREFIX"\* > "$0.copy"  # Concatenate the chunks.
rm "$OUTPREFIX"\*               # Get rid of the chunks.

exit $?

**Encoding and Encryption**

**sum**, **cksum**, **md5sum**, **sha1sum**

These are utilities for generating _checksums_. A _checksum_ is a number [\[77\]](#FTN.AEN12840) mathematically calculated from the contents of a file, for the purpose of checking its integrity. A script might refer to a list of checksums for security purposes, such as ensuring that the contents of key system files have not been altered or corrupted. For security applications, use the **md5sum** (**m**essage **d**igest **5** check**sum**) command, or better yet, the newer **sha1sum** (Secure Hash Algorithm). [\[78\]](#FTN.AEN12849)

bash$ **cksum /boot/vmlinuz**
1670054224 804083 /boot/vmlinuz

bash$ **echo -n "Top Secret" | cksum**
3391003827 10

bash$ **md5sum /boot/vmlinuz**
0f43eccea8f09e0a0b2b5cf1dcf333ba  /boot/vmlinuz

bash$ **echo -n "Top Secret" | md5sum**
8babc97a6f62a4649716f4df8d61728f  -
	      

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The **cksum** command shows the size, in bytes, of its target, whether file or stdout.

The **md5sum** and **sha1sum** commands display a [dash](#DASHREF2) when they receive their input from stdout.

**Example 16-38. Checking file integrity**

#!/bin/bash
# file-integrity.sh: Checking whether files in a given directory
#                    have been tampered with.

E\_DIR\_NOMATCH=80
E\_BAD\_DBFILE=81

dbfile=File\_record.md5
# Filename for storing records (database file).


set\_up\_database ()
{
  echo ""$directory"" > "$dbfile"
  # Write directory name to first line of file.
  md5sum "$directory"/\* >> "$dbfile"
  # Append md5 checksums and filenames.

Also see [Example A-19](#DIRECTORYINFO), [Example 36-16](#HORSERACE), and [Example 10-2](#RANDSTRING) for creative uses of the **md5sum** command.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

There have been reports that the 128-bit **md5sum** can be cracked, so the more secure 160-bit **sha1sum** is a welcome new addition to the checksum toolkit.

bash$ **md5sum testfile**
e181e2c8720c60522c4c4c981108e367  testfile

bash$ **sha1sum testfile**
5d7425a9c08a66c3177f1e31286fa40986ffc996  testfile
	      

Security consultants have demonstrated that even **sha1sum** can be compromised. Fortunately, newer Linux distros include longer bit-length **sha224sum**, **sha256sum**, **sha384sum**, and **sha512sum** commands.

**uuencode**

This utility encodes binary files (images, sound files, compressed files, etc.) into [ASCII](#ASCIIDEF) characters, making them suitable for transmission in the body of an e-mail message or in a newsgroup posting. This is especially useful where MIME (multimedia) encoding is not available.

**uudecode**

This reverses the encoding, decoding _uuencoded_ files back into the original binaries.

**Example 16-39. Uudecoding encoded files**

#!/bin/bash
# Uudecodes all uuencoded files in current working directory.

lines=35        # Allow 35 lines for the header (very generous).

for File in \*   # Test all the files in $PWD.
do
  search1=\`head -n $lines $File | grep begin | wc -w\`
  search2=\`tail -n $lines $File | grep end | wc -w\`
  #  Uuencoded files have a "begin" near the beginning,
  #+ and an "end" near the end.
  if \[ "$search1" -gt 0 \]
  then
    if \[ "$search2" -gt 0 \]
    then
      echo "uudecoding - $File -"
      uudecode $File
    fi  
  fi
done  

#  Note that running this script upon itself fools it
#+ into thinking it is a uuencoded file,
#+ because it contains both "begin" and "end".

#  Exercise:
#  --------
#  Modify this script to check each file for a newsgroup header,
#+ and skip to next if not found.

exit 0

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

The [fold -s](#FOLDREF) command may be useful (possibly in a pipe) to process long uudecoded text messages downloaded from Usenet newsgroups.

**mimencode**, **mmencode**

The **mimencode** and **mmencode** commands process multimedia-encoded e-mail attachments. Although _mail user agents_ (such as _pine_ or _kmail_) normally handle this automatically, these particular utilities permit manipulating such attachments manually from the command-line or in [batch processing mode](#BATCHPROCREF) by means of a shell script.

**crypt**

At one time, this was the standard UNIX file encryption utility. [\[79\]](#FTN.AEN12969) Politically-motivated government regulations prohibiting the export of encryption software resulted in the disappearance of **crypt** from much of the UNIX world, and it is still missing from most Linux distributions. Fortunately, programmers have come up with a number of decent alternatives to it, among them the author's very own [cruft](ftp://metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/file/cruft-0.2.tar.gz) (see [Example A-4](#ENCRYPTEDPW)).

**openssl**

This is an Open Source implementation of _Secure Sockets Layer_ encryption.

\# To encrypt a file:
openssl aes-128-ecb -salt -in file.txt -out file.encrypted \\
-pass pass:my\_password
#          ^^^^^^^^^^^   User-selected password.
#       aes-128-ecb      is the encryption method chosen.

# To decrypt an openssl-encrypted file:
openssl aes-128-ecb -d -salt -in file.encrypted -out file.txt \\
-pass pass:my\_password
#          ^^^^^^^^^^^   User-selected password.

[Piping](#PIPEREF) _openssl_ to/from [tar](#TARREF) makes it possible to encrypt an entire directory tree.

\# To encrypt a directory:

sourcedir="/home/bozo/testfiles"
encrfile="encr-dir.tar.gz"
password=my\_secret\_password

tar czvf - "$sourcedir" |
openssl des3 -salt -out "$encrfile" -pass pass:"$password"
#       ^^^^   Uses des3 encryption.
# Writes encrypted file "encr-dir.tar.gz" in current working directory.

# To decrypt the resulting tarball:
openssl des3 -d -salt -in "$encrfile" -pass pass:"$password" |
tar -xzv
# Decrypts and unpacks into current working directory.

Of course, _openssl_ has many other uses, such as obtaining signed _certificates_ for Web sites. See the [info](#INFOREF) page.

**shred**

Securely erase a file by overwriting it multiple times with random bit patterns before deleting it. This command has the same effect as [Example 16-61](#BLOTOUT), but does it in a more thorough and elegant manner.

This is one of the GNU _fileutils_.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Advanced forensic technology may still be able to recover the contents of a file, even after application of **shred**.

**Miscellaneous**

**mktemp**

Create a _temporary file_ [\[80\]](#FTN.AEN13030) with a "unique" filename. When invoked from the command-line without additional arguments, it creates a zero-length file in the /tmp directory.

bash$ **mktemp**
/tmp/tmp.zzsvql3154
	      

PREFIX=filename
tempfile=\`mktemp $PREFIX.XXXXXX\`
#                        ^^^^^^ Need at least 6 placeholders
#+                              in the filename template.
#   If no filename template supplied,
#+ "tmp.XXXXXXXXXX" is the default.

echo "tempfile name = $tempfile"
# tempfile name = filename.QA2ZpY
#                 or something similar...

#  Creates a file of that name in the current working directory
#+ with 600 file permissions.
#  A "umask 177" is therefore unnecessary,
#+ but it's good programming practice nevertheless.

**make**

Utility for building and compiling binary packages. This can also be used for any set of operations triggered by incremental changes in source files.

The _make_ command checks a Makefile, a list of file dependencies and operations to be carried out.

The _make_ utility is, in effect, a powerful scripting language similar in many ways to _Bash_, but with the capability of recognizing _dependencies_. For in-depth coverage of this useful tool set, see the [GNU software documentation site](http://www.gnu.org/manual/manual.html).

**install**

Special purpose file copying command, similar to [cp](#CPREF), but capable of setting permissions and attributes of the copied files. This command seems tailormade for installing software packages, and as such it shows up frequently in Makefiles (in the _make install :_ section). It could likewise prove useful in installation scripts.

**dos2unix**

This utility, written by Benjamin Lin and collaborators, converts DOS-formatted text files (lines terminated by CR-LF) to UNIX format (lines terminated by LF only), and [vice-versa](#DOSNEWLINES).

**ptx**

The **ptx \[targetfile\]** command outputs a permuted index (cross-reference list) of the targetfile. This may be further filtered and formatted in a pipe, if necessary.

**more**, **less**

Pagers that display a text file or stream to stdout, one screenful at a time. These may be used to filter the output of stdout . . . or of a script.

An interesting application of _more_ is to "test drive" a command sequence, to forestall potentially unpleasant consequences.

ls /home/bozo | awk '{print "rm -rf " $1}' | more
#                                            ^^^^
		 
# Testing the effect of the following (disastrous) command-line:
#      ls /home/bozo | awk '{print "rm -rf " $1}' | sh
#      Hand off to the shell to execute . . .       ^^

The _less_ pager has the interesting property of doing a formatted display of _man page_ source. See [Example A-39](#MANED).

16.6. Communications Commands
=============================

Certain of the following commands find use in network data transfer and analysis, as well as in [chasing spammers](#CSPAMMERS).

**Information and Statistics**

**host**

Searches for information about an Internet host by name or IP address, using DNS.

bash$ **host surfacemail.com**
surfacemail.com. has address 202.92.42.236
	      

**ipcalc**

Displays IP information for a host. With the \-h option, **ipcalc** does a reverse DNS lookup, finding the name of the host (server) from the IP address.

bash$ **ipcalc -h 202.92.42.236**
HOSTNAME=surfacemail.com
	      

**nslookup**

Do an Internet "name server lookup" on a host by IP address. This is essentially equivalent to **ipcalc -h** or **dig -x** . The command may be run either interactively or noninteractively, i.e., from within a script.

The **nslookup** command has allegedly been "deprecated," but it is still useful.

bash$ **nslookup -sil 66.97.104.180**
nslookup kuhleersparnis.ch
 Server:         135.116.137.2
 Address:        135.116.137.2#53

 Non-authoritative answer:
 Name:   kuhleersparnis.ch
	      

**dig**

**D**omain **I**nformation **G**roper. Similar to **nslookup**, _dig_ does an Internet _name server lookup_ on a host. May be run from the command-line or from within a script.

Some interesting options to _dig_ are +time=N for setting a query timeout to _N_ seconds, +nofail for continuing to query servers until a reply is received, and \-x for doing a reverse address lookup.

Compare the output of **dig -x** with **ipcalc -h** and **nslookup**.

bash$ **dig -x 81.9.6.2**

dig +short $1.contacts.abuse.net -c in -t txt
# Also try:
#     dig +nssearch $1
#     Tries to find "authoritative name servers" and display SOA records.

# The following also works:
#     whois -h whois.abuse.net $1
#           ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Specify host.  
#     Can even lookup multiple spammers with this, i.e."
#     whois -h whois.abuse.net $spamdomain1 $spamdomain2 . . .


#  Exercise:
#  --------
#  Expand the functionality of this script
#+ so that it automatically e-mails a notification
#+ to the responsible ISP's contact address(es).

For a much more elaborate version of the above script, see [Example A-28](#ISSPAMMER2).

**traceroute**

Trace the route taken by packets sent to a remote host. This command works within a LAN, WAN, or over the Internet. The remote host may be specified by an IP address. The output of this command may be filtered by [grep](#GREPREF) or [sed](#SEDREF) in a pipe.

bash$ **traceroute 81.9.6.2**
traceroute to 81.9.6.2 (81.9.6.2), 30 hops max, 38 byte packets
 1  tc43.xjbnnbrb.com (136.30.178.8)  191.303 ms  179.400 ms  179.767 ms
 2  or0.xjbnnbrb.com (136.30.178.1)  179.536 ms  179.534 ms  169.685 ms
 3  192.168.11.101 (192.168.11.101)  189.471 ms  189.556 ms \*
 ...
	      

**ping**

Broadcast an _ICMP ECHO\_REQUEST_ packet to another machine, either on a local or remote network. This is a diagnostic tool for testing network connections, and it should be used with caution.

bash$ **ping localhost**
PING localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1) from 127.0.0.1 : 56(84) bytes of data.
 64 bytes from localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1): icmp\_seq=0 ttl=255 time=709 usec
 64 bytes from localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1): icmp\_seq=1 ttl=255 time=286 usec

 --- localhost.localdomain ping statistics ---
 2 packets transmitted, 2 packets received, 0% packet loss
 round-trip min/avg/max/mdev = 0.286/0.497/0.709/0.212 ms
	      

A successful _ping_ returns an [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) of 0. This can be tested for in a script.

  HNAME=news-15.net  # Notorious spammer.
# HNAME=$HOST     # Debug: test for localhost.
  count=2  # Send only two pings.

if \[\[ \`ping -c $count "$HNAME"\` \]\]
then
  echo ""$HNAME" still up and broadcasting spam your way."
else
  echo ""$HNAME" seems to be down. Pity."
fi

**whois**

Perform a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup. The \-h option permits specifying which particular _whois_ server to query. See [Example 4-6](#EX18) and [Example 16-40](#SPAMLOOKUP).

**finger**

Retrieve information about users on a network. Optionally, this command can display a user's ~/.plan, ~/.project, and ~/.forward files, if present.

bash$ **finger**
Login  Name           Tty      Idle  Login Time   Office     Office Phone

Out of security considerations, many networks disable **finger** and its associated daemon. [\[81\]](#FTN.AEN13320)

**chfn**

Change information disclosed by the **finger** command.

**vrfy**

Verify an Internet e-mail address.

This command seems to be missing from newer Linux distros.

**Remote Host Access**

**sx**, **rx**

The **sx** and **rx** command set serves to transfer files to and from a remote host using the _xmodem_ protocol. These are generally part of a communications package, such as **minicom**.

**sz**, **rz**

The **sz** and **rz** command set serves to transfer files to and from a remote host using the _zmodem_ protocol. _Zmodem_ has certain advantages over _xmodem_, such as faster transmission rate and resumption of interrupted file transfers. Like **sx** and **rx**, these are generally part of a communications package.

**ftp**

Utility and protocol for uploading / downloading files to or from a remote host. An ftp session can be automated in a script (see [Example 19-6](#EX72) and [Example A-4](#ENCRYPTEDPW)).

**uucp**, **uux**, **cu**

**uucp**: _UNIX to UNIX copy_. This is a communications package for transferring files between UNIX servers. A shell script is an effective way to handle a **uucp** command sequence.

Since the advent of the Internet and e-mail, **uucp** seems to have faded into obscurity, but it still exists and remains perfectly workable in situations where an Internet connection is not available or appropriate. The advantage of **uucp** is that it is fault-tolerant, so even if there is a service interruption the copy operation will resume where it left off when the connection is restored.

\---

**uux**: _UNIX to UNIX execute_. Execute a command on a remote system. This command is part of the **uucp** package.

\---

**cu**: **C**all **U**p a remote system and connect as a simple terminal. It is a sort of dumbed-down version of [telnet](#TELNETREF). This command is part of the **uucp** package.

**telnet**

Utility and protocol for connecting to a remote host.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

The _telnet_ protocol contains security holes and should therefore probably be avoided. Its use within a shell script is _not_ recommended.

**wget**

The **wget** utility _noninteractively_ retrieves or downloads files from a Web or ftp site. It works well in a script.

wget -p http://www.xyz23.com/file01.html
#  The -p or --page-requisite option causes wget to fetch all files
#+ required to display the specified page.

wget -r ftp://ftp.xyz24.net/~bozo/project\_files/ -O $SAVEFILE
#  The -r option recursively follows and retrieves all links
#+ on the specified site.

wget -c ftp://ftp.xyz25.net/bozofiles/filename.tar.bz2
#  The -c option lets wget resume an interrupted download.
#  This works with ftp servers and many HTTP sites.

**Example 16-42. Getting a stock quote**

#!/bin/bash
# quote-fetch.sh: Download a stock quote.


E\_NOPARAMS=86

if \[ -z "$1" \]  # Must specify a stock (symbol) to fetch.
  then echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` stock-symbol"
  exit $E\_NOPARAMS
fi

stock\_symbol=$1

file\_suffix=.html
# Fetches an HTML file, so name it appropriately.
URL='http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s='
# Yahoo finance board, with stock query suffix.

# -----------------------------------------------------------
wget -O ${stock\_symbol}${file\_suffix} "${URL}${stock\_symbol}"
# -----------------------------------------------------------


# To look up stuff on http://search.yahoo.com:
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# URL="http://search.yahoo.com/search?fr=ush-news&p=${query}"
# wget -O "$savefilename" "${URL}"
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# Saves a list of relevant URLs.

exit $?

# Exercises:
# ---------
#
# 1) Add a test to ensure the user running the script is on-line.
#    (Hint: parse the output of 'ps -ax' for "ppp" or "connect."
#
# 2) Modify this script to fetch the local weather report,
#+   taking the user's zip code as an argument.

**lynx**

The **lynx** Web and file browser can be used inside a script (with the \-dump option) to retrieve a file from a Web or ftp site noninteractively.

lynx -dump http://www.xyz23.com/file01.html >$SAVEFILE

With the \-traversal option, **lynx** starts at the HTTP URL specified as an argument, then "crawls" through all links located on that particular server. Used together with the \-crawl option, outputs page text to a log file.

**rlogin**

_Remote login_, initates a session on a remote host. This command has security issues, so use [ssh](#SSHREF) instead.

**rsh**

_Remote shell_, executes command(s) on a remote host. This has security issues, so use **ssh** instead.

**rcp**

_Remote copy_, copies files between two different networked machines.

**rsync**

_Remote synchronize_, updates (synchronizes) files between two different networked machines.

bash$ **rsync -a ~/sourcedir/\*txt /node1/subdirectory/**

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Using [rcp](#RCPREF), [rsync](#RSYNCREF), and similar utilities with security implications in a shell script may not be advisable. Consider, instead, using **ssh**, [scp](#SCPREF), or an **expect** script.

**ssh**

_Secure shell_, logs onto a remote host and executes commands there. This secure replacement for **telnet**, **rlogin**, **rcp**, and **rsh** uses identity authentication and encryption. See its [manpage](#MANREF) for details.

**Example 16-44. Using _ssh_**

#!/bin/bash
# remote.bash: Using ssh.

# This example by Michael Zick.
# Used with permission.


#   Presumptions:
#   ------------
#   fd-2 isn't being captured ( '2>/dev/null' ).
#   ssh/sshd presumes stderr ('2') will display to user.
#
#   sshd is running on your machine.
#   For any 'standard' distribution, it probably is,
#+  and without any funky ssh-keygen having been done.

# Try ssh to your machine from the command-line:
#
# $ ssh $HOSTNAME
# Without extra set-up you'll be asked for your password.
#   enter password
#   when done,  $ exit
#
# Did that work? If so, you're ready for more fun.

# Try ssh to your machine as 'root':
#
#   $  ssh -l root $HOSTNAME
#   When asked for password, enter root's, not yours.
#          Last login: Tue Aug 10 20:25:49 2004 from localhost.localdomain
#   Enter 'exit' when done.

#  The above gives you an interactive shell.
#  It is possible for sshd to be set up in a 'single command' mode,
#+ but that is beyond the scope of this example.
#  The only thing to note is that the following will work in
#+ 'single command' mode.


# A basic, write stdout (local) command.

ls -l

# Now the same basic command on a remote machine.
# Pass a different 'USERNAME' 'HOSTNAME' if desired:
USER=${USERNAME:-$(whoami)}
HOST=${HOSTNAME:-$(hostname)}

#  Now excute the above command-line on the remote host,
#+ with all transmissions encrypted.

ssh -l ${USER} ${HOST} " ls -l "

#  The expected result is a listing of your username's home
#+ directory on the remote machine.
#  To see any difference, run this script from somewhere
#+ other than your home directory.

#  In other words, the Bash command is passed as a quoted line
#+ to the remote shell, which executes it on the remote machine.
#  In this case, sshd does  ' bash -c "ls -l" '   on your behalf.

#  For information on topics such as not having to enter a
#+ password/passphrase for every command-line, see
#+    man ssh
#+    man ssh-keygen
#+    man sshd\_config.

exit 0

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Within a loop, **ssh** may cause unexpected behavior. According to a [Usenet post](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/comp.unix.shell/msg/dcb446b5fff7d230) in the comp.unix shell archives, **ssh** inherits the loop's stdin. To remedy this, pass **ssh** either the \-n or \-f option.

Thanks, Jason Bechtel, for pointing this out.

**scp**

_Secure copy_, similar in function to **rcp**, copies files between two different networked machines, but does so using authentication, and with a security level similar to **ssh**.

**Local Network**

**write**

This is a utility for terminal-to-terminal communication. It allows sending lines from your terminal (console or _xterm_) to that of another user. The [mesg](#MESGREF) command may, of course, be used to disable write access to a terminal

Since **write** is interactive, it would not normally find use in a script.

**netconfig**

A command-line utility for configuring a network adapter (using _DHCP_). This command is native to Red Hat centric Linux distros.

**Mail**

**mail**

Send or read e-mail messages.

This stripped-down command-line mail client works fine as a command embedded in a script.

**Example 16-45. A script that mails itself**

#!/bin/sh
# self-mailer.sh: Self-mailing script

adr=${1:-\`whoami\`}     # Default to current user, if not specified.
#  Typing 'self-mailer.sh wiseguy@superdupergenius.com'
#+ sends this script to that addressee.
#  Just 'self-mailer.sh' (no argument) sends the script
#+ to the person invoking it, for example, bozo@localhost.localdomain.
#
#  For more on the ${parameter:-default} construct,
#+ see the "Parameter Substitution" section
#+ of the "Variables Revisited" chapter.

# ============================================================================
  cat $0 | mail -s "Script \\"\`basename $0\`\\" has mailed itself to you." "$adr"
# ============================================================================

# --------------------------------------------
#  Greetings from the self-mailing script.
#  A mischievous person has run this script,
#+ which has caused it to mail itself to you.
#  Apparently, some people have nothing better
#+ to do with their time.
# --------------------------------------------

echo "At \`date\`, script \\"\`basename $0\`\\" mailed to "$adr"."

exit 0

#  Note that the "mailx" command (in "send" mode) may be substituted
#+ for "mail" ... but with somewhat different options.

**mailto**

Similar to the **mail** command, **mailto** sends e-mail messages from the command-line or in a script. However, **mailto** also permits sending MIME (multimedia) messages.

**mailstats**

Show _mail statistics_. This command may be invoked only by _root_.

root# **mailstats**
Statistics from Tue Jan  1 20:32:08 2008
  M   msgsfr  bytes\_from   msgsto    bytes\_to  msgsrej msgsdis msgsqur  Mailer

**vacation**

This utility automatically replies to e-mails that the intended recipient is on vacation and temporarily unavailable. It runs on a network, in conjunction with **sendmail**, and is not applicable to a dial-up POPmail account.

* * *

16.7. Terminal Control Commands
===============================

**Command affecting the console or terminal**

**tput**

Initialize terminal and/or fetch information about it from terminfo data. Various options permit certain terminal operations: **tput clear** is the equivalent of [clear](#CLEARREF); **tput reset** is the equivalent of [reset](#RESETREF).

bash$ **tput longname**
xterm terminal emulator (X Window System)
	      

Issuing a **tput cup X Y** moves the cursor to the (X,Y) coordinates in the current terminal. A **clear** to erase the terminal screen would normally precede this.

Some interesting options to _tput_ are:

*   bold, for high-intensity text
    
*   smul, to underline text in the terminal
    
*   smso, to render text in reverse
    
*   sgr0, to reset the terminal parameters (to normal), without clearing the screen
    

Example scripts using _tput_:

1.  [Example 36-15](#COLORECHO)
    
2.  [Example 36-13](#EX30A)
    
3.  [Example A-44](#HOMEWORK)
    
4.  [Example A-42](#NIM)
    
5.  [Example 27-2](#POEM)
    

Note that [stty](#STTYREF) offers a more powerful command set for controlling a terminal.

**infocmp**

This command prints out extensive information about the current terminal. It references the _terminfo_ database.

bash$ **infocmp**
\#       Reconstructed via infocmp from file:
 /usr/share/terminfo/r/rxvt
 rxvt|rxvt terminal emulator (X Window System), 
         am, bce, eo, km, mir, msgr, xenl, xon, 
         colors#8, cols#80, it#8, lines#24, pairs#64, 
         acsc=\`\`aaffggjjkkllmmnnooppqqrrssttuuvvwwxxyyzz{{||}}~~, 
         bel=^G, blink=\\E\[5m, bold=\\E\[1m,
         civis=\\E\[?25l, 
         clear=\\E\[H\\E\[2J, cnorm=\\E\[?25h, cr=^M, 
         ...
	      

**reset**

Reset terminal parameters and clear text screen. As with **clear**, the cursor and prompt reappear in the upper lefthand corner of the terminal.

**clear**

The **clear** command simply clears the text screen at the console or in an _xterm_. The prompt and cursor reappear at the upper lefthand corner of the screen or xterm window. This command may be used either at the command line or in a script. See [Example 11-26](#EX30).

**resize**

Echoes commands necessary to set $TERM and $TERMCAP to duplicate the _size_ (dimensions) of the current terminal.

bash$ **resize**
set noglob;
 setenv COLUMNS '80';
 setenv LINES '24';
 unset noglob;
	        

**script**

This utility records (saves to a file) all the user keystrokes at the command-line in a console or an xterm window. This, in effect, creates a record of a session.

* * *

16.8. Math Commands
===================

**"Doing the numbers"**

**factor**

Decompose an integer into prime factors.

bash$ **factor 27417**
27417: 3 13 19 37
	      

**Example 16-46. Generating prime numbers**

#!/bin/bash
# primes2.sh

#  Generating prime numbers the quick-and-easy way,
#+ without resorting to fancy algorithms.

CEILING=10000   # 1 to 10000
PRIME=0
E\_NOTPRIME=

is\_prime ()
{
  local factors
  factors=( $(factor $1) )  # Load output of \`factor\` into array.

if \[ -z "${factors\[2\]}" \]
#  Third element of "factors" array:
#+ ${factors\[2\]} is 2nd factor of argument.
#  If it is blank, then there is no 2nd factor,
#+ and the argument is therefore prime.
then
  return $PRIME             # 0
else
  return $E\_NOTPRIME        # null
fi
}

echo
for n in $(seq $CEILING)
do
  if is\_prime $n
  then
    printf %5d $n
  fi   #    ^  Five positions per number suffices.
done   #       For a higher $CEILING, adjust upward, as necessary.

echo

exit

**bc**

Bash can't handle floating point calculations, and it lacks operators for certain important mathematical functions. Fortunately, **bc** gallops to the rescue.

Not just a versatile, arbitrary precision calculation utility, **bc** offers many of the facilities of a programming language. It has a syntax vaguely resembling **C**.

Since it is a fairly well-behaved UNIX utility, and may therefore be used in a [pipe](#PIPEREF), **bc** comes in handy in scripts.

Here is a simple template for using **bc** to calculate a script variable. This uses [command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF).

	      **variable=$(echo "OPTIONS; OPERATIONS" | bc)**
	      

**Example 16-47. Monthly Payment on a Mortgage**

#!/bin/bash
# monthlypmt.sh: Calculates monthly payment on a mortgage.


#  This is a modification of code in the
#+ "mcalc" (mortgage calculator) package,
#+ by Jeff Schmidt
#+ and
#+ Mendel Cooper (yours truly, the ABS Guide author).
#   http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/apps/financial/mcalc-1.6.tar.gz

echo
echo "Given the principal, interest rate, and term of a mortgage,"
echo "calculate the monthly payment."

bottom=1.0

echo
echo -n "Enter principal (no commas) "
read principal
echo -n "Enter interest rate (percent) "  # If 12%, enter "12", not ".12".
read interest\_r
echo -n "Enter term (months) "
read term


 interest\_r=$(echo "scale=9; $interest\_r/100.0" | bc) # Convert to decimal.
                 #           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Divide by 100. 
                 # "scale" determines how many decimal places.

 interest\_rate=$(echo "scale=9; $interest\_r/12 + 1.0" | bc)
 

 top=$(echo "scale=9; $principal\*$interest\_rate^$term" | bc)
          #           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
          #           Standard formula for figuring interest.

 echo; echo "Please be patient. This may take a while."

 let "months = $term - 1"
# ==================================================================== 
 for ((x=$months; x > 0; x--))
 do
   bot=$(echo "scale=9; $interest\_rate^$x" | bc)
   bottom=$(echo "scale=9; $bottom+$bot" | bc)
#  bottom = $(($bottom + $bot"))
 done
# ==================================================================== 

# -------------------------------------------------------------------- 
#  Rick Boivie pointed out a more efficient implementation
#+ of the above loop, which decreases computation time by 2/3.

# for ((x=1; x <= $months; x++))
# do
#   bottom=$(echo "scale=9; $bottom \* $interest\_rate + 1" | bc)
# done


#  And then he came up with an even more efficient alternative,
#+ one that cuts down the run time by about 95%!

# bottom=\`{
#     echo "scale=9; bottom=$bottom; interest\_rate=$interest\_rate"
#     for ((x=1; x <= $months; x++))
#     do
#          echo 'bottom = bottom \* interest\_rate + 1'
#     done
#     echo 'bottom'

An alternate method of invoking **bc** involves using a [here document](#HEREDOCREF) embedded within a [command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF) block. This is especially appropriate when a script needs to pass a list of options and commands to **bc**.

...or...


variable=$(bc << LIMIT\_STRING

**Example 16-50. Calculating PI**

#!/bin/bash
# cannon.sh: Approximating PI by firing cannonballs.

# Author: Mendel Cooper
# License: Public Domain
# Version 2.2, reldate 13oct08.

# This is a very simple instance of a "Monte Carlo" simulation:
#+ a mathematical model of a real-life event,
#+ using pseudorandom numbers to emulate random chance.

#  Consider a perfectly square plot of land, 10000 units on a side.
#  This land has a perfectly circular lake in its center,
#+ with a diameter of 10000 units.
#  The plot is actually mostly water, except for land in the four corners.
#  (Think of it as a square with an inscribed circle.)
#
#  We will fire iron cannonballs from an old-style cannon
#+ at the square.
#  All the shots impact somewhere on the square,
#+ either in the lake or on the dry corners.
#  Since the lake takes up most of the area,
#+ most of the shots will SPLASH! into the water.
#  Just a few shots will THUD! into solid ground
#+ in the four corners of the square.
#
#  If we take enough random, unaimed shots at the square,
#+ Then the ratio of SPLASHES to total shots will approximate
#+ the value of PI/4.
#
#  The simplified explanation is that the cannon is actually
#+ shooting only at the upper right-hand quadrant of the square,
#+ i.e., Quadrant I of the Cartesian coordinate plane.
#
#
#  Theoretically, the more shots taken, the better the fit.
#  However, a shell script, as opposed to a compiled language
#+ with floating-point math built in, requires some compromises.
#  This decreases the accuracy of the simulation.


DIMENSION=10000  # Length of each side of the plot.
                 # Also sets ceiling for random integers generated.

**dc**

The **dc** (**d**esk **c**alculator) utility is [stack-oriented](#STACKDEFREF) and uses RPN (_Reverse Polish Notation_). Like **bc**, it has much of the power of a programming language.

Similar to the procedure with **bc**, [echo](#ECHOREF) a command-string to **dc**.

echo "\[Printing a string ... \]P" | dc
# The P command prints the string between the preceding brackets.

# And now for some simple arithmetic.
echo "7 8 \* p" | dc     # 56
#  Pushes 7, then 8 onto the stack,
#+ multiplies ("\*" operator), then prints the result ("p" operator).

Most persons avoid **dc**, because of its non-intuitive input and rather cryptic operators. Yet, it has its uses.

**Example 16-51. Converting a decimal number to hexadecimal**

#!/bin/bash
# hexconvert.sh: Convert a decimal number to hexadecimal.

E\_NOARGS=85 # Command-line arg missing.
BASE=16     # Hexadecimal.

if \[ -z "$1" \]
then        # Need a command-line argument.
  echo "Usage: $0 number"
  exit $E\_NOARGS
fi          # Exercise: add argument validity checking.


hexcvt ()
{
if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  echo 0
  return    # "Return" 0 if no arg passed to function.
fi

echo ""$1" "$BASE" o p" | dc
#                  o    sets radix (numerical base) of output.
#                    p  prints the top of stack.
# For other options: 'man dc' ...
return
}

hexcvt "$1"

exit

Studying the [info](#INFOREF) page for **dc** is a painful path to understanding its intricacies. There seems to be a small, select group of _dc wizards_ who delight in showing off their mastery of this powerful, but arcane utility.

bash$ **echo "16i\[q\]sa\[ln0=aln100%Pln100/snlbx\]sbA0D68736142snlbxq" | dc**
Bash

#  ^^^            Feed operations to dc using a Here String.
#      ^^^        Pushes 10 and sets that as the precision (10k).
#         ^^      Pushes 5 and takes its square root
#                 (5v, v = square root).
#           ^^    Pushes 1 and adds it to the running total (1+).
#             ^^  Pushes 2 and divides the running total by that (2/).
#               ^ Pops and prints the result (p)
#  The result is  1.6180339887 ...
#  ... which happens to be the Pythagorean Golden Ratio, to 10 places.

**awk**

Yet another way of doing floating point math in a script is using [awk's](#AWKREF) built-in math functions in a [shell wrapper](#SHWRAPPER).

**Example 16-53. Calculating the hypotenuse of a triangle**

#!/bin/bash
# hypotenuse.sh: Returns the "hypotenuse" of a right triangle.
#                (square root of sum of squares of the "legs")

ARGS=2                # Script needs sides of triangle passed.
E\_BADARGS=85          # Wrong number of arguments.

if \[ $# -ne "$ARGS" \] # Test number of arguments to script.
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` side\_1 side\_2"
  exit $E\_BADARGS
fi


AWKSCRIPT=' { printf( "%3.7f\\n", sqrt($1\*$1 + $2\*$2) ) } '
#             command(s) / parameters passed to awk


# Now, pipe the parameters to awk.
    echo -n "Hypotenuse of $1 and $2 = "
    echo $1 $2 | awk "$AWKSCRIPT"
#   ^^^^^^^^^^^^
# An echo-and-pipe is an easy way of passing shell parameters to awk.

exit

# Exercise: Rewrite this script using 'bc' rather than awk.
#           Which method is more intuitive?

16.9. Miscellaneous Commands
============================

**Command that fit in no special category**

**jot**, **seq**

These utilities emit a sequence of integers, with a user-selectable increment.

The default separator character between each integer is a newline, but this can be changed with the \-s option.

bash$ **seq 5**
1
 2
 3
 4
 5

bash$ **seq -s : 5**
1:2:3:4:5
	      

Both **jot** and **seq** come in handy in a [for loop](#FORLOOPREF1).

**Example 16-54. Using _seq_ to generate loop arguments**

#!/bin/bash
# Using "seq"

echo

for a in \`seq 80\`  # or   for a in $( seq 80 )
# Same as   for a in 1 2 3 4 5 ... 80   (saves much typing!).
# May also use 'jot' (if present on system).
do
  echo -n "$a "
done      # 1 2 3 4 5 ... 80
# Example of using the output of a command to generate 
# the \[list\] in a "for" loop.

echo; echo


COUNT=80  # Yes, 'seq' also accepts a replaceable parameter.

for a in \`seq $COUNT\`  # or   for a in $( seq $COUNT )
do
  echo -n "$a "
done      # 1 2 3 4 5 ... 80

echo; echo

BEGIN=75
END=80

for a in \`seq $BEGIN $END\`
#  Giving "seq" two arguments starts the count at the first one,
#+ and continues until it reaches the second.
do
  echo -n "$a "
done      # 75 76 77 78 79 80

echo; echo

BEGIN=45
INTERVAL=5
END=80

for a in \`seq $BEGIN $INTERVAL $END\`
#  Giving "seq" three arguments starts the count at the first one,
#+ uses the second for a step interval,
#+ and continues until it reaches the third.
do
  echo -n "$a "
done      # 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80

echo; echo

exit 0

A simpler example:

\#  Create a set of 10 files,
#+ named file.1, file.2 . . . file.10.
COUNT=10
PREFIX=file

for filename in \`seq $COUNT\`
do
  touch $PREFIX.$filename
  #  Or, can do other operations,
  #+ such as rm, grep, etc.
done

      fi  
done

exit $?

#  This script has exactly the same functionality as letter-count2.sh,
#+ but executes faster.
#  Why?

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Somewhat more capable than _seq_, **jot** is a classic UNIX utility that is not normally included in a standard Linux distro. However, the source _rpm_ is available for download from the [MIT repository](http://www.mit.edu/afs/athena/system/rhlinux/athena-9.0/free/SRPMS/athena-jot-9.0-3.src.rpm).

Unlike _seq_, **jot** can generate a sequence of random numbers, using the \-r option.

bash$ **jot -r 3 999**
1069
 1272
 1428

**getopt**

The **getopt** command parses command-line options preceded by a [dash](#DASHREF). This external command corresponds to the [getopts](#GETOPTSX) Bash builtin. Using **getopt** permits handling long options by means of the \-l flag, and this also allows parameter reshuffling.

**Example 16-56. Using _getopt_ to parse command-line options**

#!/bin/bash
# Using getopt

# Try the following when invoking this script:
#   sh ex33a.sh -a
#   sh ex33a.sh -abc
#   sh ex33a.sh -a -b -c
#   sh ex33a.sh -d
#   sh ex33a.sh -dXYZ
#   sh ex33a.sh -d XYZ
#   sh ex33a.sh -abcd
#   sh ex33a.sh -abcdZ
#   sh ex33a.sh -z
#   sh ex33a.sh a
# Explain the results of each of the above.

E\_OPTERR=65

if \[ "$#" -eq 0 \]
then   # Script needs at least one command-line argument.
  echo "Usage $0 -\[options a,b,c\]"
  exit $E\_OPTERR
fi  

set -- \`getopt "abcd:" "$@"\`
# Sets positional parameters to command-line arguments.
# What happens if you use "$\*" instead of "$@"?

while \[ ! -z "$1" \]
do
  case "$1" in
    -a) echo "Option \\"a\\"";;
    -b) echo "Option \\"b\\"";;
    -c) echo "Option \\"c\\"";;
    -d) echo "Option \\"d\\" $2";;
     \*) break;;
  esac

  shift
done

#  It is usually better to use the 'getopts' builtin in a script.
#  See "ex33.sh."

exit 0

![Note](../images/note.gif)

As _Peggy Russell_ points out:

It is often necessary to include an [eval](#EVALREF) to correctly process [whitespace](#WHITESPACEREF) and _quotes_.

args=$(getopt -o a:bc:d -- "$@")
eval set -- "$args"

See [Example 10-5](#GETOPTSIMPLE) for a simplified emulation of **getopt**.

**run-parts**

The **run-parts** command [\[82\]](#FTN.AEN14105) executes all the scripts in a target directory, sequentially in ASCII-sorted filename order. Of course, the scripts need to have execute permission.

The [cron](#CRONREF) [daemon](#DAEMONREF) invokes **run-parts** to run the scripts in the /etc/cron.\* directories.

**yes**

In its default behavior the **yes** command feeds a continuous string of the character y followed by a line feed to stdout. A **control**\-**C** terminates the run. A different output string may be specified, as in **yes different string**, which would continually output different string to stdout.

One might well ask the purpose of this. From the command-line or in a script, the output of **yes** can be redirected or piped into a program expecting user input. In effect, this becomes a sort of poor man's version of _expect_.

**yes | fsck /dev/hda1** runs **fsck** non-interactively (careful!).

**yes | rm -r dirname** has same effect as **rm -rf dirname** (careful!).

![Warning](../images/warning.gif)

Caution advised when piping _yes_ to a potentially dangerous system command, such as [fsck](#FSCKREF) or [fdisk](#FDISKREF). It might have unintended consequences.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The _yes_ command parses variables, or more accurately, it echoes parsed variables. For example:

bash$ **yes $BASH\_VERSION**
3.1.17(1)-release
 3.1.17(1)-release
 3.1.17(1)-release
 3.1.17(1)-release
 3.1.17(1)-release
 . . .
	      

This particular "feature" may be used to create a _very large_ ASCII file on the fly:

bash$ **yes $PATH > huge\_file.txt**
**Ctl-C**	      
	      

Hit **Ctl-C** _very quickly_, or you just might get more than you bargained for. . . .

The _yes_ command may be emulated in a very simple script [function](#FUNCTIONREF).

yes ()
{ # Trivial emulation of "yes" ...
  local DEFAULT\_TEXT="y"
  while \[ true \]   # Endless loop.
  do
    if \[ -z "$1" \]
    then
      echo "$DEFAULT\_TEXT"
    else           # If argument ...
      echo "$1"    # ... expand and echo it.
    fi
  done             #  The only things missing are the
}                  #+ --help and --version options.

**banner**

Prints arguments as a large vertical banner to stdout, using an [ASCII](#ASCIIDEF) character (default '#'). This may be redirected to a printer for hardcopy.

Note that _banner_ has been dropped from many Linux distros, presumably because it is no longer considered useful.

**printenv**

Show all the [environmental variables](#ENVREF) set for a particular user.

bash$ **printenv | grep HOME**
HOME=/home/bozo
	      

**lp**

The **lp** and **lpr** commands send file(s) to the print queue, to be printed as hard copy. [\[83\]](#FTN.AEN14214) These commands trace the origin of their names to the line printers of another era. [\[84\]](#FTN.AEN14218)

bash$ **lp file1.txt** or bash **lp <file1.txt**

It is often useful to pipe the formatted output from **pr** to **lp**.

bash$ **pr -options file1.txt | lp**

Formatting packages, such as [groff](#GROFFREF) and _Ghostscript_ may send their output directly to **lp**.

bash$ **groff -Tascii file.tr | lp**

bash$ **gs -options | lp file.ps**

Related commands are **lpq**, for viewing the print queue, and **lprm**, for removing jobs from the print queue.

**tee**

\[UNIX borrows an idea from the plumbing trade.\]

This is a redirection operator, but with a difference. Like the plumber's _tee,_ it permits "siphoning off" _to a file_ the output of a command or commands within a pipe, but without affecting the result. This is useful for printing an ongoing process to a file or paper, perhaps to keep track of it for debugging purposes.

                             (redirection)
                            |----> to file
                            |
  ==========================|====================
  command ---> command ---> |tee ---> command ---> ---> output of pipe
  ===============================================
	      

cat listfile\* | sort | tee check.file | uniq > result.file
#                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   ^^^^    

#  The file "check.file" contains the concatenated sorted "listfiles,"
#+ before the duplicate lines are removed by 'uniq.'

**mkfifo**

This obscure command creates a _named pipe_, a temporary _first-in-first-out buffer_ for transferring data between processes. [\[85\]](#FTN.AEN14280) Typically, one process writes to the FIFO, and the other reads from it. See [Example A-14](#FIFO).

#!/bin/bash
# This short script by Omair Eshkenazi.
# Used in ABS Guide with permission (thanks!).

mkfifo pipe1   # Yes, pipes can be given names.
mkfifo pipe2   # Hence the designation "named pipe."

(cut -d' ' -f1 | tr "a-z" "A-Z") >pipe2 <pipe1 &
ls -l | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f3,9- | tee pipe1 |
cut -d' ' -f2 | paste - pipe2

rm -f pipe1
rm -f pipe2

# No need to kill background processes when script terminates (why not?).

exit $?

Now, invoke the script and explain the output:
sh mkfifo-example.sh

4830.tar.gz          BOZO
pipe1   BOZO
pipe2   BOZO
mkfifo-example.sh    BOZO
Mixed.msg BOZO

**pathchk**

This command checks the validity of a filename. If the filename exceeds the maximum allowable length (255 characters) or one or more of the directories in its path is not searchable, then an error message results.

Unfortunately, **pathchk** does not return a recognizable error code, and it is therefore pretty much useless in a script. Consider instead the [file test operators](#RTIF).

**dd**

Though this somewhat obscure and much feared **d**ata **d**uplicator command originated as a utility for exchanging data on magnetic tapes between UNIX minicomputers and IBM mainframes, it still has its uses. The **dd** command simply copies a file (or stdin/stdout), but with conversions. Possible conversions include ASCII/EBCDIC, [\[86\]](#FTN.AEN14318) upper/lower case, swapping of byte pairs between input and output, and skipping and/or truncating the head or tail of the input file.

\# Converting a file to all uppercase:

dd if=$filename conv=ucase > $filename.uppercase
#                    lcase   # For lower case conversion

Some basic options to **dd** are:

*   if=INFILE
    
    INFILE is the _source_ file.
    
*   of=OUTFILE
    
    OUTFILE is the _target_ file, the file that will have the data written to it.
    
*   bs=BLOCKSIZE
    
    This is the size of each block of data being read and written, usually a power of 2.
    
*   skip=BLOCKS
    
    How many blocks of data to skip in INFILE before starting to copy. This is useful when the INFILE has "garbage" or garbled data in its header or when it is desirable to copy only a portion of the INFILE.
    
*   seek=BLOCKS
    
    How many blocks of data to skip in OUTFILE before starting to copy, leaving blank data at beginning of OUTFILE.
    
*   count=BLOCKS
    
    Copy only this many blocks of data, rather than the entire INFILE.
    
*   conv=CONVERSION
    
    Type of conversion to be applied to INFILE data before copying operation.
    

A **dd --help** lists all the options this powerful utility takes.

**Example 16-57. A script that copies itself**

#!/bin/bash
# self-copy.sh

# This script copies itself.

file\_subscript=copy

dd if=$0 of=$0.$file\_subscript 2>/dev/null
# Suppress messages from dd:   ^^^^^^^^^^^

exit $?

#  A program whose only output is its own source code
#+ is called a "quine" per Willard Quine.
#  Does this script qualify as a quine?

**Example 16-58. Exercising _dd_**

#!/bin/bash
# exercising-dd.sh

# Script by Stephane Chazelas.
# Somewhat modified by ABS Guide author.

infile=$0           # This script.
outfile=log.txt     # Output file left behind.
n=8
p=11

dd if=$infile of=$outfile bs=1 skip=$((n-1)) count=$((p-n+1)) 2> /dev/null
# Extracts characters n to p (8 to 11) from this script ("bash").

# ----------------------------------------------------------------

echo -n "hello vertical world" | dd cbs=1 conv=unblock 2> /dev/null
# Echoes "hello vertical world" vertically downward.
# Why? A newline follows each character dd emits.

exit $?

To demonstrate just how versatile **dd** is, let's use it to capture keystrokes.

**Example 16-59. Capturing Keystrokes**

#!/bin/bash
# dd-keypress.sh: Capture keystrokes without needing to press ENTER.


keypresses=4                      # Number of keypresses to capture.


old\_tty\_setting=$(stty -g)        # Save old terminal settings.

echo "Press $keypresses keys."
stty -icanon -echo                # Disable canonical mode.
                                  # Disable local echo.
keys=$(dd bs=1 count=$keypresses 2> /dev/null)
# 'dd' uses stdin, if "if" (input file) not specified.

stty "$old\_tty\_setting"           # Restore old terminal settings.

echo "You pressed the \\"$keys\\" keys."

# Thanks, Stephane Chazelas, for showing the way.
exit 0

The **dd** command can do random access on a data stream.

echo -n . | dd bs=1 seek=4 of=file conv=notrunc
#  The "conv=notrunc" option means that the output file
#+ will not be truncated.

# Thanks, S.C.

The **dd** command can copy raw data and disk images to and from devices, such as floppies and tape drives ([Example A-5](#COPYCD)). A common use is creating boot floppies.

**dd if=kernel-image of=/dev/fd0H1440**

Similarly, **dd** can copy the entire contents of a floppy, even one formatted with a "foreign" OS, to the hard drive as an image file.

**dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/home/bozo/projects/floppy.img**

Likewise, **dd** can create bootable flash drives and SD cards.

**dd if=image.iso of=/dev/sdb**

**Example 16-60. Preparing a bootable SD card for the _Raspberry Pi_**

#!/bin/bash
# rp.sdcard.sh
# Preparing an SD card with a bootable image for the Raspberry Pi.

# $1 = imagefile name
# $2 = sdcard (device file)
# Otherwise defaults to the defaults, see below.

DEFAULTbs=4M                                 # Block size, 4 mb default.
DEFAULTif="2013-07-26-wheezy-raspbian.img"   # Commonly used distro.
DEFAULTsdcard="/dev/mmcblk0"                 # May be different. Check!
ROOTUSER\_NAME=root                           # Must run as root!
E\_NOTROOT=81
E\_NOIMAGE=82

username=$(id -nu)                           # Who is running this script?
if \[ "$username" != "$ROOTUSER\_NAME" \]
then
  echo "This script must run as root or with root privileges."
  exit $E\_NOTROOT
fi

if \[ -n "$1" \]
then
  imagefile="$1"
else
  imagefile="$DEFAULTif"
fi

if \[ -n "$2" \]
then
  sdcard="$2"
else
  sdcard="$DEFAULTsdcard"
fi

if \[ ! -e $imagefile \]
then
  echo "Image file \\"$imagefile\\" not found!"
  exit $E\_NOIMAGE
fi

echo "Last chance to change your mind!"; echo
read -s -n1 -p "Hit a key to write $imagefile to $sdcard \[Ctl-c to exit\]."
echo; echo

echo "Writing $imagefile to $sdcard ..."
dd bs=$DEFAULTbs if=$imagefile of=$sdcard

exit $?

# Exercises:
# ---------
# 1) Provide additional error checking.
# 2) Have script autodetect device file for SD card (difficult!).
# 3) Have script sutodetect image file (\*img) in $PWD.

Other applications of **dd** include initializing temporary swap files ([Example 31-2](#EX73)) and ramdisks ([Example 31-3](#RAMDISK)). It can even do a low-level copy of an entire hard drive partition, although this is not necessarily recommended.

People (with presumably nothing better to do with their time) are constantly thinking of interesting applications of **dd**.

**Example 16-61. Securely deleting a file**

#!/bin/bash
# blot-out.sh: Erase "all" traces of a file.

#  This is a fairly secure, if inefficient and slow method
#+ of thoroughly "shredding" a file.
#  The "shred" command, part of the GNU "fileutils" package,
#+ does the same thing, although more efficiently.

#  The file cannot not be "undeleted" or retrieved by normal methods.

#  This script may not play well with a journaled file system.
#  Exercise (difficult): Fix it so it does.



#  Tom Vier's "wipe" file-deletion package does a much more thorough job
#+ of file shredding than this simple script.

See also the [dd thread](#DDLINK) entry in the [bibliography](#BIBLIOREF).

**od**

The **od**, or _octal dump_ filter converts input (or files) to octal (base-8) or other bases. This is useful for viewing or processing binary data files or otherwise unreadable system [device files](#DEVFILEREF), such as /dev/urandom, and as a filter for binary data.

head -c4 /dev/urandom | od -N4 -tu4 | sed -ne '1s/.\* //p'
# Sample output: 1324725719, 3918166450, 2989231420, etc.

# From rnd.sh example script, by StÃ©phane Chazelas

See also [Example 9-16](#SEEDINGRANDOM) and [Example A-36](#INSERTIONSORT).

**hexdump**

Performs a hexadecimal, octal, decimal, or ASCII dump of a binary file. This command is the rough equivalent of **od**, above, but not nearly as useful. May be used to view the contents of a binary file, in combination with [dd](#DDREF) and [less](#LESSREF).

dd if=/bin/ls | hexdump -C | less
# The -C option nicely formats the output in tabular form.

**objdump**

Displays information about an object file or binary executable in either hexadecimal form or as a disassembled listing (with the \-d option).

bash$ **objdump -d /bin/ls**
/bin/ls:     file format elf32-i386

 Disassembly of section .init:

 080490bc <.init>:
  80490bc:       55                      push   %ebp
  80490bd:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
  . . .
	      

**mcookie**

This command generates a "magic cookie," a 128-bit (32-character) pseudorandom hexadecimal number, normally used as an authorization "signature" by the X server. This also available for use in a script as a "quick 'n dirty" random number.

random000=$(mcookie)

Of course, a script could use [md5sum](#MD5SUMREF) for the same purpose.

\# Generate md5 checksum on the script itself.
random001=\`md5sum $0 | awk '{print $1}'\`
# Uses 'awk' to strip off the filename.

The **mcookie** command gives yet another way to generate a "unique" filename.

**Example 16-62. Filename generator**

#!/bin/bash
# tempfile-name.sh:  temp filename generator

BASE\_STR=\`mcookie\`   # 32-character magic cookie.
POS=11               # Arbitrary position in magic cookie string.
LEN=5                # Get $LEN consecutive characters.

prefix=temp          #  This is, after all, a "temp" file.
                     #  For more "uniqueness," generate the
                     #+ filename prefix using the same method
                     #+ as the suffix, below.

suffix=${BASE\_STR:POS:LEN}
                     #  Extract a 5-character string,
                     #+ starting at position 11.

temp\_filename=$prefix.$suffix
                     # Construct the filename.

echo "Temp filename = "$temp\_filename""

# sh tempfile-name.sh
# Temp filename = temp.e19ea

#  Compare this method of generating "unique" filenames
#+ with the 'date' method in ex51.sh.

exit 0

**units**

This utility converts between different _units of measure_. While normally invoked in interactive mode, **units** may find use in a script.

**Example 16-63. Converting meters to miles**

#!/bin/bash
# unit-conversion.sh
# Must have 'units' utility installed.


convert\_units ()  # Takes as arguments the units to convert.
{
  cf=$(units "$1" "$2" | sed --silent -e '1p' | awk '{print $2}')
  # Strip off everything except the actual conversion factor.
  echo "$cf"
}  

Unit1=miles
Unit2=meters
cfactor=\`convert\_units $Unit1 $Unit2\`
quantity=3.73

result=$(echo $quantity\*$cfactor | bc)

echo "There are $result $Unit2 in $quantity $Unit1."

#  What happens if you pass incompatible units,
#+ such as "acres" and "miles" to the function?

exit 0

# Exercise: Edit this script to accept command-line parameters,
#           with appropriate error checking, of course.

**m4**

A hidden treasure, **m4** is a powerful macro [\[87\]](#FTN.AEN14523) processing filter, virtually a complete language. Although originally written as a pre-processor for _RatFor_, **m4** turned out to be useful as a stand-alone utility. In fact, **m4** combines some of the functionality of [eval](#EVALREF), [tr](#TRREF), and [awk](#AWKREF), in addition to its extensive macro expansion facilities.

The April, 2002 issue of [_Linux Journal_](http://www.linuxjournal.com) has a very nice article on **m4** and its uses.

**Example 16-64. Using _m4_**

#!/bin/bash
# m4.sh: Using the m4 macro processor

# Strings
string=abcdA01
echo "len($string)" | m4                            #   7
echo "substr($string,4)" | m4                       # A01
echo "regexp($string,\[0-1\]\[0-1\],\\&Z)" | m4      # 01Z

# Arithmetic
var=99
echo "incr($var)" | m4                              #  100
echo "eval($var / 3)" | m4                          #   33

exit

**xmessage**

This X-based variant of [echo](#ECHOREF) pops up a message/query window on the desktop.

xmessage Left click to continue -button okay

**zenity**

The [zenity](http://freshmeat.net/projects/zenity) utility is adept at displaying _GTK+_ dialog [widgets](#WIDGETREF) and [very suitable for scripting purposes](#ZENITYREF2).

**doexec**

The **doexec** command enables passing an arbitrary list of arguments to a _binary executable_. In particular, passing _argv\[0\]_ (which corresponds to [$0](#POSPARAMREF1) in a script) lets the executable be invoked by various names, and it can then carry out different sets of actions, according to the name by which it was called. What this amounts to is roundabout way of passing options to an executable.

For example, the /usr/local/bin directory might contain a binary called "aaa". Invoking **doexec /usr/local/bin/aaa list** would _list_ all those files in the current working directory beginning with an "a", while invoking (the same executable with) **doexec /usr/local/bin/aaa delete** would _delete_ those files.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The various behaviors of the executable must be defined within the code of the executable itself, analogous to something like the following in a shell script:

case \`basename $0\` in
"name1" ) do\_something;;
"name2" ) do\_something\_else;;
"name3" ) do\_yet\_another\_thing;;
\*       ) bail\_out;;
esac

**dialog**

The [dialog](#DIALOGREF) family of tools provide a method of calling interactive "dialog" boxes from a script. The more elaborate variations of **dialog** -- **gdialog**, **Xdialog**, and **kdialog** -- actually invoke X-Windows [widgets](#WIDGETREF).

**sox**

The **sox**, or "**so**und e**x**change" command plays and performs transformations on sound files. In fact, the /usr/bin/play executable (now deprecated) is nothing but a shell wrapper for _sox_.

For example, **sox soundfile.wav soundfile.au** changes a WAV sound file into a (Sun audio format) AU sound file.

Shell scripts are ideally suited for batch-processing **sox** operations on sound files. For examples, see the [Linux Radio Timeshift HOWTO](http://osl.iu.edu/~tveldhui/radio/) and the [MP3do Project](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/audiodo).

Chapter 17. System and Administrative Commands
==============================================

The startup and shutdown scripts in /etc/rc.d illustrate the uses (and usefulness) of many of these comands. These are usually invoked by _root_ and used for system maintenance or emergency filesystem repairs. Use with caution, as some of these commands may damage your system if misused.

**Users and Groups**

**users**

Show all logged on users. This is the approximate equivalent of **who -q**.

**groups**

Lists the current user and the groups she belongs to. This corresponds to the [$GROUPS](#GROUPSREF) internal variable, but gives the group names, rather than the numbers.

bash$ **groups**
bozita cdrom cdwriter audio xgrp

bash$ **echo $GROUPS**
501

**chown**, **chgrp**

The **chown** command changes the ownership of a file or files. This command is a useful method that _root_ can use to shift file ownership from one user to another. An ordinary user may not change the ownership of files, not even her own files. [\[88\]](#FTN.AEN14695)

root# **chown bozo \*.txt**

	      

The **chgrp** command changes the _group_ ownership of a file or files. You must be owner of the file(s) as well as a member of the destination group (or _root_) to use this operation.

chgrp --recursive dunderheads \*.data
#  The "dunderheads" group will now own all the "\*.data" files
#+ all the way down the $PWD directory tree (that's what "recursive" means).

**useradd**, **userdel**

The **useradd** administrative command adds a user account to the system and creates a home directory for that particular user, if so specified. The corresponding **userdel** command removes a user account from the system [\[89\]](#FTN.AEN14727) and deletes associated files.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The **adduser** command is a synonym for **useradd** and is usually a symbolic link to it.

**usermod**

Modify a user account. Changes may be made to the password, group membership, expiration date, and other attributes of a given user's account. With this command, a user's password may be locked, which has the effect of disabling the account.

**groupmod**

Modify a given group. The group name and/or ID number may be changed using this command.

**id**

The **id** command lists the real and effective user IDs and the group IDs of the user associated with the current process. This is the counterpart to the [$UID](#UIDREF), [$EUID](#EUIDREF), and [$GROUPS](#GROUPSREF) internal Bash variables.

bash$ **id**
uid=501(bozo) gid=501(bozo) groups=501(bozo),22(cdrom),80(cdwriter),81(audio)

bash$ **echo $UID**
501

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The **id** command shows the _effective_ IDs only when they differ from the _real_ ones.

Also see [Example 9-5](#AMIROOT).

**lid**

The _lid_ (list ID) command shows the group(s) that a given user belongs to, or alternately, the users belonging to a given group. May be invoked only by root.

root# **lid bozo**

**who**

Show all users logged on to the system.

bash$ **who**
bozo  tty1     Apr 27 17:45
 bozo  pts/0    Apr 27 17:46
 bozo  pts/1    Apr 27 17:47
 bozo  pts/2    Apr 27 17:49
	      

The \-m gives detailed information about only the current user. Passing any two arguments to **who** is the equivalent of **who -m**, as in **who am i** or **who The Man**.

bash$ **who -m**
localhost.localdomain!bozo  pts/2    Apr 27 17:49
	      

**whoami** is similar to **who -m**, but only lists the user name.

bash$ **whoami**
bozo
	      

**w**

Show all logged on users and the processes belonging to them. This is an extended version of **who**. The output of **w** may be piped to [grep](#GREPREF) to find a specific user and/or process.

bash$ **w | grep startx**
bozo  tty1     -                 4:22pm  6:41   4.47s  0.45s  startx

**logname**

Show current user's login name (as found in /var/run/utmp). This is a near-equivalent to [whoami](#WHOAMIREF), above.

bash$ **logname**
bozo

bash$ **whoami**
bozo

However . . .

bash$ **su**
Password: ......

bash# **whoami**
root
bash# **logname**
bozo

![Note](../images/note.gif)

While **logname** prints the name of the logged in user, **whoami** gives the name of the user attached to the current process. As we have just seen, sometimes these are not the same.

**su**

Runs a program or script as a **s**ubstitute **u**ser. **su rjones** starts a shell as user _rjones_. A naked **su** defaults to _root_. See [Example A-14](#FIFO).

**sudo**

Runs a command as _root_ (or another user). This may be used in a script, thus permitting a _regular user_ to run the script.

#!/bin/bash

# Some commands.
sudo cp /root/secretfile /home/bozo/secret
# Some more commands.

The file /etc/sudoers holds the names of users permitted to invoke **sudo**.

**passwd**

Sets, changes, or manages a user's password.

The **passwd** command can be used in a script, but probably _should not_ be.

**Example 17-1. Setting a new password**

#!/bin/bash
#  setnew-password.sh: For demonstration purposes only.
#                      Not a good idea to actually run this script.
#  This script must be run as root.

ROOT\_UID=0         # Root has $UID 0.
E\_WRONG\_USER=65    # Not root?

E\_NOSUCHUSER=70
SUCCESS=0


if \[ "$UID" -ne "$ROOT\_UID" \]
then
  echo; echo "Only root can run this script."; echo
  exit $E\_WRONG\_USER
else
  echo
  echo "You should know better than to run this script, root."
  echo "Even root users get the blues... "
  echo
fi  


username=bozo
NEWPASSWORD=security\_violation

# Check if bozo lives here.
grep -q "$username" /etc/passwd
if \[ $? -ne $SUCCESS \]
then
  echo "User $username does not exist."
  echo "No password changed."
  exit $E\_NOSUCHUSER
fi  

echo "$NEWPASSWORD" | passwd --stdin "$username"
#  The '--stdin' option to 'passwd' permits
#+ getting a new password from stdin (or a pipe).

echo; echo "User $username's password changed!"

# Using the 'passwd' command in a script is dangerous.

exit 0

The **passwd** command's \-l, \-u, and \-d options permit locking, unlocking, and deleting a user's password. Only _root_ may use these options.

**ac**

Show users' logged in time, as read from /var/log/wtmp. This is one of the GNU accounting utilities.

bash$ **ac**
        total       68.08

**last**

List _last_ logged in users, as read from /var/log/wtmp. This command can also show remote logins.

For example, to show the last few times the system rebooted:

bash$ **last reboot**
reboot   system boot  2.6.9-1.667      Fri Feb  4 18:18          (00:02)    
 reboot   system boot  2.6.9-1.667      Fri Feb  4 15:20          (01:27)    
 reboot   system boot  2.6.9-1.667      Fri Feb  4 12:56          (00:49)    
 reboot   system boot  2.6.9-1.667      Thu Feb  3 21:08          (02:17)    
 . . .

 wtmp begins Tue Feb  1 12:50:09 2005

**newgrp**

Change user's _group ID_ without logging out. This permits access to the new group's files. Since users may be members of multiple groups simultaneously, this command finds only limited use.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Kurt Glaesemann points out that the _newgrp_ command could prove helpful in setting the default group permissions for files a user writes. However, the [chgrp](#CHGRPREF) command might be more convenient for this purpose.

**Terminals**

**tty**

Echoes the name (filename) of the current user's terminal. Note that each separate _xterm_ window counts as a different terminal.

bash$ **tty**
/dev/pts/1

**stty**

Shows and/or changes terminal settings. This complex command, used in a script, can control terminal behavior and the way output displays. See the info page, and study it carefully.

**Example 17-2. Setting an _erase_ character**

#!/bin/bash
# erase.sh: Using "stty" to set an erase character when reading input.

echo -n "What is your name? "
read name                      #  Try to backspace
                               #+ to erase characters of input.
                               #  Problems?
echo "Your name is $name."

stty erase '#'                 #  Set "hashmark" (#) as erase character.
echo -n "What is your name? "
read name                      #  Use # to erase last character typed.
echo "Your name is $name."

exit 0

# Even after the script exits, the new key value remains set.
# Exercise: How would you reset the erase character to the default value?

**Example 17-3. _secret password_: Turning off terminal echoing**

#!/bin/bash
# secret-pw.sh: secret password

echo
echo -n "Enter password "
read passwd
echo "password is $passwd"
echo -n "If someone had been looking over your shoulder, "
echo "your password would have been compromised."

echo && echo  # Two line-feeds in an "and list."


stty -echo    # Turns off screen echo.
#   May also be done with
#   read -sp passwd
#   A big Thank You to Leigh James for pointing this out.

echo -n "Enter password again "
read passwd
echo
echo "password is $passwd"
echo

stty echo     # Restores screen echo.

exit 0

# Do an 'info stty' for more on this useful-but-tricky command.

A creative use of **stty** is detecting a user keypress (without hitting **ENTER**).

**Example 17-4. Keypress detection**

#!/bin/bash
# keypress.sh: Detect a user keypress ("hot keys").

echo

old\_tty\_settings=$(stty -g)   # Save old settings (why?).
stty -icanon
Keypress=$(head -c1)          # or $(dd bs=1 count=1 2> /dev/null)
                              # on non-GNU systems

echo
echo "Key pressed was \\""$Keypress"\\"."
echo

stty "$old\_tty\_settings"      # Restore old settings.

# Thanks, Stephane Chazelas.

exit 0

Also see [Example 9-3](#TIMEOUT) and [Example A-43](#STOPWATCH).

**terminals and modes**

Normally, a terminal works in the _canonical_ mode. When a user hits a key, the resulting character does not immediately go to the program actually running in this terminal. A buffer local to the terminal stores keystrokes. When the user hits the **ENTER** key, this sends all the stored keystrokes to the program running. There is even a basic line editor inside the terminal.

bash$ **stty -a**
speed 9600 baud; rows 36; columns 96; line = 0;
 intr = ^C; quit = ^\\; erase = ^H; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>; eol2 = <undef>;
 start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; rprnt = ^R; werase = ^W; lnext = ^V; flush = ^O;
 ...
 isig icanon iexten echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh -xcase -tostop -echoprt
                

Using canonical mode, it is possible to redefine the special keys for the local terminal line editor.

bash$ **cat > filexxx**
**wha<ctl-W>I<ctl-H>foo bar<ctl-U>hello world<ENTER>**
**<ctl-D>**
bash$ **cat filexxx**
hello world		
bash$ **wc -c < filexxx**
12		
                

The process controlling the terminal receives only 12 characters (11 alphabetic ones, plus a newline), although the user hit 26 keys.

In non-canonical ("raw") mode, every key hit (including special editing keys such as **ctl-H**) sends a character immediately to the controlling process.

The Bash prompt disables both icanon and echo, since it replaces the basic terminal line editor with its own more elaborate one. For example, when you hit **ctl-A** at the Bash prompt, there's no **^A** echoed by the terminal, but Bash gets a **\\1** character, interprets it, and moves the cursor to the begining of the line.

_StÃ©phane Chazelas_

**setterm**

Set certain terminal attributes. This command writes to its terminal's stdout a string that changes the behavior of that terminal.

bash$ **setterm -cursor off**
bash$
	      

The **setterm** command can be used within a script to change the appearance of text written to stdout, although there are certainly [better tools](#COLORIZINGREF) available for this purpose.

setterm -bold on
echo bold hello

setterm -bold off
echo normal hello

**tset**

Show or initialize terminal settings. This is a less capable version of **stty**.

bash$ **tset -r**
Terminal type is xterm-xfree86.
 Kill is control-U (^U).
 Interrupt is control-C (^C).
	      

**setserial**

Set or display serial port parameters. This command must be run by _root_ and is usually found in a system setup script.

\# From /etc/pcmcia/serial script:

IRQ=\`setserial /dev/$DEVICE | sed -e 's/.\*IRQ: //'\`
setserial /dev/$DEVICE irq 0 ; setserial /dev/$DEVICE irq $IRQ

**getty**, **agetty**

The initialization process for a terminal uses **getty** or **agetty** to set it up for login by a user. These commands are not used within user shell scripts. Their scripting counterpart is **stty**.

**mesg**

Enables or disables write access to the current user's terminal. Disabling access would prevent another user on the network to [write](#WRITEREF) to the terminal.

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

It can be quite annoying to have a message about ordering pizza suddenly appear in the middle of the text file you are editing. On a multi-user network, you might therefore wish to disable write access to your terminal when you need to avoid interruptions.

**wall**

This is an acronym for "[write](#WRITEREF) all," i.e., sending a message to all users at every terminal logged into the network. It is primarily a system administrator's tool, useful, for example, when warning everyone that the system will shortly go down due to a problem (see [Example 19-1](#EX70)).

bash$ **wall System going down for maintenance in 5 minutes!**
Broadcast message from bozo (pts/1) Sun Jul  8 13:53:27 2001...

 System going down for maintenance in 5 minutes!
	      

![Note](../images/note.gif)

If write access to a particular terminal has been disabled with **mesg**, then **wall** cannot send a message to that terminal.

**Information and Statistics**

**uname**

Output system specifications (OS, kernel version, etc.) to stdout. Invoked with the \-a option, gives verbose system info (see [Example 16-5](#EX41)). The \-s option shows only the OS type.

bash$ **uname**
Linux

bash$ **uname -s**
Linux

bash$ **uname -a**
Linux iron.bozo 2.6.15-1.2054\_FC5 #1 Tue Mar 14 15:48:33 EST 2006
 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

**arch**

Show system architecture. Equivalent to **uname -m**. See [Example 11-27](#CASECMD).

bash$ **arch**
i686

bash$ **uname -m**
i686

**lastcomm**

Gives information about previous commands, as stored in the /var/account/pacct file. Command name and user name can be specified by options. This is one of the GNU accounting utilities.

**lastlog**

List the last login time of all system users. This references the /var/log/lastlog file.

bash$ **lastlog**
root          tty1                      Fri Dec  7 18:43:21 -0700 2001
 bin                                     \*\*Never logged in\*\*
 daemon                                  \*\*Never logged in\*\*
 ...
 bozo          tty1                      Sat Dec  8 21:14:29 -0700 2001

bash$ **lastlog | grep root**
root          tty1                      Fri Dec  7 18:43:21 -0700 2001
	      

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

This command will fail if the user invoking it does not have read permission for the /var/log/lastlog file.

**lsof**

List open files. This command outputs a detailed table of all currently open files and gives information about their owner, size, the processes associated with them, and more. Of course, **lsof** may be piped to [grep](#GREPREF) and/or [awk](#AWKREF) to parse and analyze its results.

bash$ **lsof**
COMMAND    PID    USER   FD   TYPE     DEVICE    SIZE     NODE NAME
 init         1    root  mem    REG        3,5   30748    30303 /sbin/init
 init         1    root  mem    REG        3,5   73120     8069 /lib/ld-2.1.3.so
 init         1    root  mem    REG        3,5  931668     8075 /lib/libc-2.1.3.so
 cardmgr    213    root  mem    REG        3,5   36956    30357 /sbin/cardmgr
 ...
	      

The **lsof** command is a useful, if complex administrative tool. If you are unable to dismount a filesystem and get an error message that it is still in use, then running _lsof_ helps determine which files are still open on that filesystem. The \-i option lists open network socket files, and this can help trace intrusion or hack attempts.

bash$ **lsof -an -i tcp**
COMMAND  PID USER  FD  TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME
 firefox 2330 bozo  32u IPv4   9956       TCP 66.0.118.137:57596->67.112.7.104:http ...
 firefox 2330 bozo  38u IPv4  10535       TCP 66.0.118.137:57708->216.79.48.24:http ...
	      

See [Example 30-2](#IPADDRESSES) for an effective use of **lsof**.

**strace**

**S**ystem **trace**: diagnostic and debugging tool for tracing _system calls_ and signals. This command and **ltrace**, following, are useful for diagnosing why a given program or package fails to run . . . perhaps due to missing libraries or related causes.

bash$ **strace df**
execve("/bin/df", \["df"\], \[/\* 45 vars \*/\]) = 0
 uname({sys="Linux", node="bozo.localdomain", ...}) = 0
 brk(0)                                  = 0x804f5e4

 ...
	    

This is the Linux equivalent of the Solaris **truss** command.

**ltrace**

**L**ibrary **trace**: diagnostic and debugging tool that traces _library calls_ invoked by a given command.

bash$ **ltrace df**
\_\_libc\_start\_main(0x804a910, 1, 0xbfb589a4, 0x804fb70, 0x804fb68 <unfinished ...>:
 setlocale(6, "")                                 = "en\_US.UTF-8"
bindtextdomain("coreutils", "/usr/share/locale") = "/usr/share/locale"
textdomain("coreutils")                          = "coreutils"
\_\_cxa\_atexit(0x804b650, 0, 0, 0x8052bf0, 0xbfb58908) = 0
getenv("DF\_BLOCK\_SIZE")                          = NULL

 ...
	    

**nc**

The **nc** (_netcat_) utility is a complete toolkit for connecting to and listening to TCP and UDP ports. It is useful as a diagnostic and testing tool and as a component in simple script-based HTTP clients and servers.

bash$ **nc localhost.localdomain 25**
220 localhost.localdomain ESMTP Sendmail 8.13.1/8.13.1;

**free**

Shows memory and cache usage in tabular form. The output of this command lends itself to parsing, using [grep](#GREPREF), [awk](#AWKREF) or **Perl**. The **procinfo** command shows all the information that **free** does, and much more.

bash$ **free**
                total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
   Mem:         30504      28624       1880      15820       1608       16376

   Swap:        68540       3128      65412

To show unused RAM memory:

bash$ **free | grep Mem | awk '{ print $4 }'**
1880

**procinfo**

Extract and list information and statistics from the [/proc pseudo-filesystem](#DEVPROCREF). This gives a very extensive and detailed listing.

bash$ **procinfo | grep Bootup**
Bootup: Wed Mar 21 15:15:50 2001    Load average: 0.04 0.21 0.34 3/47 6829

**du**

Show (disk) file usage, recursively. Defaults to current working directory, unless otherwise specified.

bash$ **du -ach**

 1.0k    ./tst.sh
 1.0k    ./random.file
 6.0k    .
 6.0k    total

**df**

Shows filesystem usage in tabular form.

bash$ **df**
Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
 /dev/hda5               273262     92607    166547  36% /

 /dev/hda7              1408796   1075744    261488  80% /usr

**dmesg**

Lists all system bootup messages to stdout. Handy for debugging and ascertaining which device drivers were installed and which system interrupts in use. The output of **dmesg** may, of course, be parsed with [grep](#GREPREF), [sed](#SEDREF), or [awk](#AWKREF) from within a script.

bash$ **dmesg | grep hda**
Kernel command line: ro root=/dev/hda2
 hda: IBM-DLGA-23080, ATA DISK drive
 hda: 6015744 sectors (3080 MB) w/96KiB Cache, CHS=746/128/63

**stat**

Gives detailed and verbose _stat_istics on a given file (even a directory or device file) or set of files.

bash$ **stat test.cru**
  File: "test.cru"
   Size: 49970        Allocated Blocks: 100          Filetype: Regular File
   Mode: (0664/-rw-rw-r--)         Uid: (  501/ bozo)  Gid: (  501/ bozo)

 Modify: Sat Jun  2 16:40:24 2001
 Change: Sat Jun  2 16:40:24 2001
	      

If the target file does not exist, **stat** returns an error message.

bash$ **stat nonexistent-file**
nonexistent-file: No such file or directory
	      

In a script, you can use **stat** to extract information about files (and filesystems) and set variables accordingly.

#!/bin/bash

**vmstat**

Display virtual memory statistics.

bash$ **vmstat**
   procs                      memory    swap          io system         cpu
 r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache  si  so    bi    bo   in    cs  us  sy id

**uptime**

Shows how long the system has been running, along with associated statistics.

bash$ **uptime**
10:28pm  up  1:57,  3 users,  load average: 0.17, 0.34, 0.27

![Note](../images/note.gif)

A _load average_ of 1 or less indicates that the system handles processes immediately. A load average greater than 1 means that processes are being queued. When the load average gets above 3 (on a single-core processor), then system performance is significantly degraded.

**hostname**

Lists the system's host name. This command sets the host name in an /etc/rc.d setup script (/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit or similar). It is equivalent to **uname -n**, and a counterpart to the [$HOSTNAME](#HOSTNAMEREF) internal variable.

bash$ **hostname**
localhost.localdomain

bash$ **echo $HOSTNAME**
localhost.localdomain

Similar to the **hostname** command are the **domainname**, **dnsdomainname**, **nisdomainname**, and **ypdomainname** commands. Use these to display or set the system DNS or NIS/YP domain name. Various options to **hostname** also perform these functions.

**hostid**

Echo a 32-bit hexadecimal numerical identifier for the host machine.

bash$ **hostid**
7f0100

![Note](../images/note.gif)

This command allegedly fetches a "unique" serial number for a particular system. Certain product registration procedures use this number to brand a particular user license. Unfortunately, **hostid** only returns the machine network address in hexadecimal, with pairs of bytes transposed.

The network address of a typical non-networked Linux machine, is found in /etc/hosts.

bash$ **cat /etc/hosts**
127.0.0.1               localhost.localdomain localhost

As it happens, transposing the bytes of **127.0.0.1**, we get **0.127.1.0**, which translates in hex to **007f0100**, the exact equivalent of what **hostid** returns, above. There exist only a few million other Linux machines with this identical _hostid_.

**sar**

Invoking **sar** (System Activity Reporter) gives a very detailed rundown on system statistics. The Santa Cruz Operation ("Old" SCO) released **sar** as Open Source in June, 1999.

This command is not part of the base Linux distribution, but may be obtained as part of the [sysstat utilities](http://perso.wanadoo.fr/sebastien.godard/) package, written by [Sebastien Godard](mailto:sebastien.godard@wanadoo.fr).

**readelf**

Show information and statistics about a designated _elf_ binary. This is part of the _binutils_ package.

bash$ **readelf -h /bin/bash**
ELF Header:
   Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
   Class:                             ELF32

   Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)
   . . .

**size**

The **size \[/path/to/binary\]** command gives the segment sizes of a binary executable or archive file. This is mainly of use to programmers.

bash$ **size /bin/bash**
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  495971   22496   17392  535859   82d33 /bin/bash
	      

**System Logs**

**logger**

Appends a user-generated message to the system log (/var/log/messages). You do not have to be _root_ to invoke **logger**.

logger Experiencing instability in network connection at 23:10, 05/21.
# Now, do a 'tail /var/log/messages'.

By embedding a **logger** command in a script, it is possible to write debugging information to /var/log/messages.

logger -t $0 -i Logging at line "$LINENO".
# The "-t" option specifies the tag for the logger entry.
# The "-i" option records the process ID.

# tail /var/log/message
# ...
# Jul  7 20:48:58 localhost ./test.sh\[1712\]: Logging at line 3.

**logrotate**

This utility manages the system log files, rotating, compressing, deleting, and/or e-mailing them, as appropriate. This keeps the /var/log from getting cluttered with old log files. Usually [cron](#CRONREF) runs **logrotate** on a daily basis.

Adding an appropriate entry to /etc/logrotate.conf makes it possible to manage personal log files, as well as system-wide ones.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Stefano Falsetto has created [rottlog](http://www.gnu.org/software/rottlog/), which he considers to be an improved version of **logrotate**.

**Job Control**

**ps**

_P_rocess _S_tatistics: lists currently executing processes by owner and PID (process ID). This is usually invoked with ax or aux options, and may be piped to [grep](#GREPREF) or [sed](#SEDREF) to search for a specific process (see [Example 15-14](#EX44) and [Example 29-3](#PIDID)).

bash$  **ps ax | grep sendmail**
295 ?	   S	  0:00 sendmail: accepting connections on port 25

To display system processes in graphical "tree" format: **ps afjx** or **ps ax --forest**.

**pgrep**, **pkill**

Combining the **ps** command with [grep](#GREPREF) or [kill](#KILLREF).

bash$ **ps a | grep mingetty**
2212 tty2     Ss+    0:00 /sbin/mingetty tty2
 2213 tty3     Ss+    0:00 /sbin/mingetty tty3
 2214 tty4     Ss+    0:00 /sbin/mingetty tty4
 2215 tty5     Ss+    0:00 /sbin/mingetty tty5
 2216 tty6     Ss+    0:00 /sbin/mingetty tty6
 4849 pts/2    S+     0:00 grep mingetty

bash$ **pgrep mingetty**
2212 mingetty
 2213 mingetty
 2214 mingetty
 2215 mingetty
 2216 mingetty
	      

Compare the action of **pkill** with [killall](#KILLALLREF).

**pstree**

Lists currently executing processes in "tree" format. The \-p option shows the PIDs, as well as the process names.

**top**

Continuously updated display of most cpu-intensive processes. The \-b option displays in text mode, so that the output may be parsed or accessed from a script.

bash$ **top -b**
  8:30pm  up 3 min,  3 users,  load average: 0.49, 0.32, 0.13
 45 processes: 44 sleeping, 1 running, 0 zombie, 0 stopped

   ...  
	      

**nice**

Run a background job with an altered priority. Priorities run from 19 (lowest) to -20 (highest). Only _root_ may set the negative (higher) priorities. Related commands are **renice** and **snice**, which change the priority of a running process or processes, and **skill**, which sends a [kill](#KILLREF) signal to a process or processes.

**nohup**

Keeps a command running even after user logs off. The command will run as a foreground process unless followed by &. If you use **nohup** within a script, consider coupling it with a [wait](#WAITREF) to avoid creating an _orphan_ or [zombie](#ZOMBIEREF) process.

**pidof**

Identifies _process ID (PID)_ of a running job. Since job control commands, such as [kill](#KILLREF) and [renice](#NICE2REF) act on the _PID_ of a process (not its name), it is sometimes necessary to identify that _PID_. The **pidof** command is the approximate counterpart to the [$PPID](#PPIDREF) internal variable.

bash$ **pidof xclock**
880
	      

**Example 17-6. _pidof_ helps kill a process**

#!/bin/bash
# kill-process.sh

NOPROCESS=2

process=xxxyyyzzz  # Use nonexistent process.
# For demo purposes only...
# ... don't want to actually kill any actual process with this script.
#
# If, for example, you wanted to use this script to logoff the Internet,
#     process=pppd

t=\`pidof $process\`       # Find pid (process id) of $process.
# The pid is needed by 'kill' (can't 'kill' by program name).

if \[ -z "$t" \]           # If process not present, 'pidof' returns null.
then
  echo "Process $process was not running."
  echo "Nothing killed."
  exit $NOPROCESS
fi  

kill $t                  # May need 'kill -9' for stubborn process.

# Need a check here to see if process allowed itself to be killed.
# Perhaps another " t=\`pidof $process\` " or ...


# This entire script could be replaced by
#        kill $(pidof -x process\_name)
# or
#        killall process\_name
# but it would not be as instructive.

exit 0

**fuser**

Identifies the processes (by PID) that are accessing a given file, set of files, or directory. May also be invoked with the \-k option, which kills those processes. This has interesting implications for system security, especially in scripts preventing unauthorized users from accessing system services.

bash$ **fuser -u /usr/bin/vim**
/usr/bin/vim:         3207e(bozo)

bash$ **fuser -u /dev/null**
/dev/null:            3009(bozo)  3010(bozo)  3197(bozo)  3199(bozo)
	      

One important application for **fuser** is when physically inserting or removing storage media, such as CD ROM disks or USB flash drives. Sometimes trying a [umount](#UMOUNTREF) fails with a device is busy error message. This means that some user(s) and/or process(es) are accessing the device. An **fuser -um /dev/device\_name** will clear up the mystery, so you can kill any relevant processes.

bash$ **umount /mnt/usbdrive**
umount: /mnt/usbdrive: device is busy

bash$ **fuser -um /dev/usbdrive**
/mnt/usbdrive:        1772c(bozo)

bash$ **kill -9 1772**
bash$ **umount /mnt/usbdrive**
	      

The **fuser** command, invoked with the \-n option identifies the processes accessing a _port_. This is especially useful in combination with [nmap](#NMAPREF).

root# **nmap localhost.localdomain**
PORT     STATE SERVICE
 25/tcp   open  smtp

root# **fuser -un tcp 25**
25/tcp:               2095(root)

root# **ps ax | grep 2095 | grep -v grep**
2095 ?        Ss     0:00 sendmail: accepting connections
	      

**cron**

Administrative program scheduler, performing such duties as cleaning up and deleting system log files and updating the slocate database. This is the _superuser_ version of [at](#ATREF) (although each user may have their own crontab file which can be changed with the **crontab** command). It runs as a [daemon](#DAEMONREF) and executes scheduled entries from /etc/crontab.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Some flavors of Linux run **crond**, Matthew Dillon's version of **cron**.

**Process Control and Booting**

**init**

The **init** command is the [parent](#FORKREF) of all processes. Called in the final step of a bootup, **init** determines the runlevel of the system from /etc/inittab. Invoked by its alias **telinit**, and by _root_ only.

**telinit**

Symlinked to **init**, this is a means of changing the system runlevel, usually done for system maintenance or emergency filesystem repairs. Invoked only by _root_. This command can be dangerous -- be certain you understand it well before using!

**runlevel**

Shows the current and last runlevel, that is, whether the system is halted (runlevel 0), in single-user mode (1), in multi-user mode (2 or 3), in X Windows (5), or rebooting (6). This command accesses the /var/run/utmp file.

**halt**, **shutdown**, **reboot**

Command set to shut the system down, usually just prior to a power down.

![Warning](../images/warning.gif)

On some Linux distros, the **halt** command has 755 permissions, so it can be invoked by a non-root user. A careless _halt_ in a terminal or a script may shut down the system!

**service**

Starts or stops a system _service_. The startup scripts in /etc/init.d and /etc/rc.d use this command to start services at bootup.

root# **/sbin/service iptables stop**
Flushing firewall rules:                                   \[  OK  \]
 Setting chains to policy ACCEPT: filter                    \[  OK  \]
 Unloading iptables modules:                                \[  OK  \]
	      

**Network**

**nmap**

**N**etwork **map**per and port scanner. This command scans a server to locate open ports and the services associated with those ports. It can also report information about packet filters and firewalls. This is an important security tool for locking down a network against hacking attempts.

#!/bin/bash

SERVER=$HOST                           # localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1).
PORT\_NUMBER=25                         # SMTP port.

nmap $SERVER | grep -w "$PORT\_NUMBER"  # Is that particular port open?
#              grep -w matches whole words only,
#+             so this wouldn't match port 1025, for example.

exit 0

# 25/tcp     open        smtp

**ifconfig**

Network _interface configuration_ and tuning utility.

bash$ **ifconfig -a**
lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
           inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
           UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:16436  Metric:1
           RX packets:10 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
           TX packets:10 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
           collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 
           RX bytes:700 (700.0 b)  TX bytes:700 (700.0 b)

The **ifconfig** command is most often used at bootup to set up the interfaces, or to shut them down when rebooting.

**netstat**

Show current network statistics and information, such as routing tables and active connections. This utility accesses information in /proc/net ([Chapter 29](#DEVPROC)). See [Example 29-4](#CONSTAT).

**netstat -r** is equivalent to [route](#ROUTEREF).

bash$ **netstat**

 unix  3      \[ \]         STREAM     CONNECTED     4513
 . . .

![Note](../images/note.gif)

A **netstat -lptu** shows [sockets](#SOCKETREF) that are listening to ports, and the associated processes. This can be useful for determining whether a computer has been hacked or compromised.

**iwconfig**

This is the command set for configuring a wireless network. It is the wireless equivalent of **ifconfig**, above.

**ip**

General purpose utility for setting up, changing, and analyzing _IP_ (Internet Protocol) networks and attached devices. This command is part of the _iproute2_ package.

bash$ **ip link show**
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP> mtu 16436 qdisc noqueue 
     link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

**route**

Show info about or make changes to the kernel routing table.

bash$ **route**

**iptables**

The **iptables** command set is a packet filtering tool used mainly for such security purposes as setting up network firewalls. This is a complex tool, and a detailed explanation of its use is beyond the scope of this document. [Oskar Andreasson's tutorial](http://www.frozentux.net/iptables-tutorial/iptables-tutorial.html) is a reasonable starting point.

See also [shutting down _iptables_](#IPTABLES01) and [Example 30-2](#IPADDRESSES).

**chkconfig**

Check network and system configuration. This command lists and manages the network and system services started at bootup in the /etc/rc?.d directory.

Originally a port from IRIX to Red Hat Linux, **chkconfig** may not be part of the core installation of some Linux flavors.

bash$ **chkconfig --list**
atd             0:off   1:off   2:off   3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
 rwhod           0:off   1:off   2:off   3:off   4:off   5:off   6:off
 ...
	      

**tcpdump**

Network packet "sniffer." This is a tool for analyzing and troubleshooting traffic on a network by dumping packet headers that match specified criteria.

Dump ip packet traffic between hosts _bozoville_ and _caduceus_:

bash$ **tcpdump ip host bozoville and caduceus**
	      

Of course, the output of **tcpdump** can be parsed with certain of the previously discussed [text processing utilities](#TPCOMMANDLISTING1).

**Filesystem**

**mount**

Mount a filesystem, usually on an external device, such as a floppy or CDROM. The file /etc/fstab provides a handy listing of available filesystems, partitions, and devices, including options, that may be automatically or manually mounted. The file /etc/mtab shows the currently mounted filesystems and partitions (including the virtual ones, such as /proc).

**mount -a** mounts all filesystems and partitions listed in /etc/fstab, except those with a noauto option. At bootup, a startup script in /etc/rc.d (rc.sysinit or something similar) invokes this to get everything mounted.

mount -t iso9660 /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
# Mounts CD ROM. ISO 9660 is a standard CD ROM filesystem.
mount /mnt/cdrom
# Shortcut, if /mnt/cdrom listed in /etc/fstab

The versatile _mount_ command can even mount an ordinary file on a block device, and the file will act as if it were a filesystem. _Mount_ accomplishes that by associating the file with a [loopback device](#LOOPBACKREF). One application of this is to mount and examine an ISO9660 filesystem image before burning it onto a CDR. [\[90\]](#FTN.AEN16255)

**Example 17-7. Checking a CD image**

\# As root...

mkdir /mnt/cdtest  # Prepare a mount point, if not already there.

mount -r -t iso9660 -o loop cd-image.iso /mnt/cdtest   # Mount the image.
#                  "-o loop" option equivalent to "losetup /dev/loop0"
cd /mnt/cdtest     # Now, check the image.
ls -alR            # List the files in the directory tree there.
                   # And so forth.

**umount**

Unmount a currently mounted filesystem. Before physically removing a previously mounted floppy or CDROM disk, the device must be **umount**ed, else filesystem corruption may result.

umount /mnt/cdrom
# You may now press the eject button and safely remove the disk.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The **automount** utility, if properly installed, can mount and unmount floppies or CDROM disks as they are accessed or removed. On "multispindle" laptops with swappable floppy and optical drives, this can cause problems, however.

**gnome-mount**

The newer Linux distros have deprecated **mount** and **umount**. The successor, for command-line mounting of removable storage devices, is **gnome-mount**. It can take the \-d option to mount a [device file](#DEVFILEREF) by its listing in /dev.

For example, to mount a USB flash drive:

bash$ **gnome-mount -d /dev/sda1**
gnome-mount 0.4

bash$ **df**
. . .
 /dev/sda1                63584     12034     51550  19% /media/disk
 

**sync**

Forces an immediate write of all updated data from buffers to hard drive (synchronize drive with buffers). While not strictly necessary, a **sync** assures the sys admin or user that the data just changed will survive a sudden power failure. In the olden days, a **sync; sync** (twice, just to make absolutely sure) was a useful precautionary measure before a system reboot.

At times, you may wish to force an immediate buffer flush, as when securely deleting a file (see [Example 16-61](#BLOTOUT)) or when the lights begin to flicker.

**losetup**

Sets up and configures [loopback devices](#LOOPBACKREF).

**Example 17-8. Creating a filesystem in a file**

SIZE=1000000  # 1 meg

head -c $SIZE < /dev/zero > file  # Set up file of designated size.
losetup /dev/loop0 file           # Set it up as loopback device.
mke2fs /dev/loop0                 # Create filesystem.
mount -o loop /dev/loop0 /mnt     # Mount it.

# Thanks, S.C.

**mkswap**

Creates a swap partition or file. The swap area must subsequently be enabled with **swapon**.

**swapon**, **swapoff**

Enable / disable swap partitition or file. These commands usually take effect at bootup and shutdown.

**mke2fs**

Create a Linux _ext2_ filesystem. This command must be invoked as _root_.

**Example 17-9. Adding a new hard drive**

#!/bin/bash

# Adding a second hard drive to system.
# Software configuration. Assumes hardware already mounted.
# From an article by the author of the ABS Guide.
# In issue #38 of \_Linux Gazette\_, http://www.linuxgazette.com.

ROOT\_UID=0     # This script must be run as root.
E\_NOTROOT=67   # Non-root exit error.

if \[ "$UID" -ne "$ROOT\_UID" \]
then
  echo "Must be root to run this script."
  exit $E\_NOTROOT
fi  

# Use with extreme caution!
# If something goes wrong, you may wipe out your current filesystem.


NEWDISK=/dev/hdb         # Assumes /dev/hdb vacant. Check!
MOUNTPOINT=/mnt/newdisk  # Or choose another mount point.


fdisk $NEWDISK
mke2fs -cv $NEWDISK1   # Check for bad blocks (verbose output).
#  Note:           ^     /dev/hdb1, \*not\* /dev/hdb!
mkdir $MOUNTPOINT
chmod 777 $MOUNTPOINT  # Makes new drive accessible to all users.


# Now, test ...
# mount -t ext2 /dev/hdb1 /mnt/newdisk
# Try creating a directory.
# If it works, umount it, and proceed.

# Final step:
# Add the following line to /etc/fstab.
# /dev/hdb1  /mnt/newdisk  ext2  defaults  1 1

exit

See also [Example 17-8](#CREATEFS) and [Example 31-3](#RAMDISK).

**mkdosfs**

Create a DOS _FAT_ filesystem.

**tune2fs**

Tune _ext2_ filesystem. May be used to change filesystem parameters, such as maximum mount count. This must be invoked as _root_.

![Warning](../images/warning.gif)

This is an extremely dangerous command. Use it at your own risk, as you may inadvertently destroy your filesystem.

**dumpe2fs**

Dump (list to stdout) very verbose filesystem info. This must be invoked as _root_.

root# **dumpe2fs /dev/hda7 | grep 'ount count'**
dumpe2fs 1.19, 13-Jul-2000 for EXT2 FS 0.5b, 95/08/09
 Mount count:              6
 Maximum mount count:      20

**hdparm**

List or change hard disk parameters. This command must be invoked as _root_, and it may be dangerous if misused.

**fdisk**

Create or change a partition table on a storage device, usually a hard drive. This command must be invoked as _root_.

![Warning](../images/warning.gif)

Use this command with extreme caution. If something goes wrong, you may destroy an existing filesystem.

**fsck**, **e2fsck**, **debugfs**

Filesystem check, repair, and debug command set.

**fsck**: a front end for checking a UNIX filesystem (may invoke other utilities). The actual filesystem type generally defaults to _ext2_.

**e2fsck**: ext2 filesystem checker.

**debugfs**: ext2 filesystem debugger. One of the uses of this versatile, but dangerous command is to (attempt to) recover deleted files. For advanced users only!

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

All of these should be invoked as _root_, and they can damage or destroy a filesystem if misused.

**badblocks**

Checks for bad blocks (physical media flaws) on a storage device. This command finds use when formatting a newly installed hard drive or testing the integrity of backup media. [\[91\]](#FTN.AEN16504) As an example, **badblocks /dev/fd0** tests a floppy disk.

The **badblocks** command may be invoked destructively (overwrite all data) or in non-destructive read-only mode. If _root user_ owns the device to be tested, as is generally the case, then _root_ must invoke this command.

**lsusb**, **usbmodules**

The **lsusb** command lists all USB (Universal Serial Bus) buses and the devices hooked up to them.

The **usbmodules** command outputs information about the driver modules for connected USB devices.

bash$ **lsusb**
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  
 Device Descriptor:
   bLength                18
   bDescriptorType         1
   bcdUSB               1.00
   bDeviceClass            9 Hub
   bDeviceSubClass         0 
   bDeviceProtocol         0 
   bMaxPacketSize0         8
   idVendor           0x0000 
   idProduct          0x0000

   . . .
	      

**lspci**

Lists _pci_ busses present.

bash$ **lspci**
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation 82845 845
 (Brookdale) Chipset Host Bridge (rev 04)
 00:01.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82845 845
 (Brookdale) Chipset AGP Bridge (rev 04)
 00:1d.0 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82801CA/CAM USB (Hub #1) (rev 02)
 00:1d.1 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82801CA/CAM USB (Hub #2) (rev 02)
 00:1d.2 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82801CA/CAM USB (Hub #3) (rev 02)
 00:1e.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation 82801 Mobile PCI Bridge (rev 42)

   . . .
	      

**mkbootdisk**

Creates a boot floppy which can be used to bring up the system if, for example, the MBR (master boot record) becomes corrupted. Of special interest is the \--iso option, which uses **mkisofs** to create a bootable _ISO9660_ filesystem image suitable for burning a bootable CDR.

The **mkbootdisk** command is actually a Bash script, written by Erik Troan, in the /sbin directory.

**mkisofs**

Creates an _ISO9660_ filesystem suitable for a CDR image.

**chroot**

CHange ROOT directory. Normally commands are fetched from [$PATH](#PATHREF), relative to /, the default _root directory_. This changes the _root_ directory to a different one (and also changes the working directory to there). This is useful for security purposes, for instance when the system administrator wishes to restrict certain users, such as those [telnetting](#TELNETREF) in, to a secured portion of the filesystem (this is sometimes referred to as confining a guest user to a "chroot jail"). Note that after a **chroot**, the execution path for system binaries is no longer valid.

A **chroot /opt** would cause references to /usr/bin to be translated to /opt/usr/bin. Likewise, **chroot /aaa/bbb /bin/ls** would redirect future instances of **ls** to /aaa/bbb as the base directory, rather than / as is normally the case. An **alias XX 'chroot /aaa/bbb ls'** in a user's [~/.bashrc](#SAMPLE-BASHRC) effectively restricts which portion of the filesystem she may run command "XX" on.

The **chroot** command is also handy when running from an emergency boot floppy (**chroot** to /dev/fd0), or as an option to **lilo** when recovering from a system crash. Other uses include installation from a different filesystem (an [rpm](#RPMREF) option) or running a readonly filesystem from a CD ROM. Invoke only as _root_, and use with care.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

It might be necessary to copy certain system files to a _chrooted_ directory, since the normal $PATH can no longer be relied upon.

**lockfile**

This utility is part of the **procmail** package ([www.procmail.org](http://www.procmail.org)). It creates a _lock file_, a _semaphore_ that controls access to a file, device, or resource.

**Definition:** A _semaphore_ is a flag or signal. (The usage originated in railroading, where a colored flag, lantern, or striped movable arm _semaphore_ indicated whether a particular track was in use and therefore unavailable for another train.) A UNIX process can check the appropriate semaphore to determine whether a particular resource is available/accessible.

The lock file serves as a flag that this particular file, device, or resource is in use by a process (and is therefore "busy"). The presence of a lock file permits only restricted access (or no access) to other processes.

lockfile /home/bozo/lockfiles/$0.lock
# Creates a write-protected lockfile prefixed with the name of the script.

lockfile /home/bozo/lockfiles/${0##\*/}.lock
# A safer version of the above, as pointed out by E. Choroba.

Lock files are used in such applications as protecting system mail folders from simultaneously being changed by multiple users, indicating that a modem port is being accessed, and showing that an instance of Firefox is using its cache. Scripts may check for the existence of a lock file created by a certain process to check if that process is running. Note that if a script attempts to create a lock file that already exists, the script will likely hang.

Normally, applications create and check for lock files in the /var/lock directory. [\[92\]](#FTN.AEN16659) A script can test for the presence of a lock file by something like the following.

appname=xyzip
# Application "xyzip" created lock file "/var/lock/xyzip.lock".

if \[ -e "/var/lock/$appname.lock" \]
then   #+ Prevent other programs & scripts
       #  from accessing files/resources used by xyzip.
  ...

**flock**

Much less useful than the **lockfile** command is **flock**. It sets an "advisory" lock on a file and then executes a command while the lock is on. This is to prevent any other process from setting a lock on that file until completion of the specified command.

flock $0 cat $0 > lockfile\_\_$0
#  Set a lock on the script the above line appears in,
#+ while listing the script to stdout.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Unlike **lockfile**, **flock** does _not_ automatically create a lock file.

**mknod**

Creates block or character [device files](#DEVFILEREF) (may be necessary when installing new hardware on the system). The **MAKEDEV** utility has virtually all of the functionality of **mknod**, and is easier to use.

**MAKEDEV**

Utility for creating device files. It must be run as _root_, and in the /dev directory. It is a sort of advanced version of **mknod**.

**tmpwatch**

Automatically deletes files which have not been accessed within a specified period of time. Usually invoked by [cron](#CRONREF) to remove stale log files.

**Backup**

**dump**, **restore**

The **dump** command is an elaborate filesystem backup utility, generally used on larger installations and networks. [\[93\]](#FTN.AEN16748) It reads raw disk partitions and writes a backup file in a binary format. Files to be backed up may be saved to a variety of storage media, including disks and tape drives. The **restore** command restores backups made with **dump**.

**fdformat**

Perform a low-level format on a floppy disk (/dev/fd0\*).

**System Resources**

**ulimit**

Sets an _upper limit_ on use of system resources. Usually invoked with the \-f option, which sets a limit on file size (**ulimit -f 1000** limits files to 1 meg maximum). [\[94\]](#FTN.AEN16782) The \-t option limits the coredump size (**ulimit -c 0** eliminates coredumps). Normally, the value of **ulimit** would be set in /etc/profile and/or ~/.bash\_profile (see [Appendix H](#FILES)).

![Important](../images/important.gif)

Judicious use of **ulimit** can protect a system against the dreaded _fork bomb_.

#!/bin/bash
# This script is for illustrative purposes only.
# Run it at your own peril -- it WILL freeze your system.

while true  #  Endless loop.
do
  $0 &      #  This script invokes itself . . .
            #+ forks an infinite number of times . . .
            #+ until the system freezes up because all resources exhausted.
done        #  This is the notorious "sorcerer's appentice" scenario.

exit 0      #  Will not exit here, because this script will never terminate.

A **ulimit -Hu XX** (where _XX_ is the user process limit) in /etc/profile would abort this script when it exceeded the preset limit.

**quota**

Display user or group disk quotas.

**setquota**

Set user or group disk quotas from the command-line.

**umask**

User file creation permissions _mask_. Limit the default file attributes for a particular user. All files created by that user take on the attributes specified by **umask**. The (octal) value passed to **umask** defines the file permissions _disabled_. For example, **umask 022** ensures that new files will have at most 755 permissions (777 NAND 022). [\[95\]](#FTN.AEN16847) Of course, the user may later change the attributes of particular files with [chmod](#CHMODREF). The usual practice is to set the value of **umask** in /etc/profile and/or ~/.bash\_profile (see [Appendix H](#FILES)).

**Example 17-10. Using _umask_ to hide an output file from prying eyes**

#!/bin/bash
# rot13a.sh: Same as "rot13.sh" script, but writes output to "secure" file.

# Usage: ./rot13a.sh filename
# or     ./rot13a.sh <filename
# or     ./rot13a.sh and supply keyboard input (stdin)

umask 177               #  File creation mask.
                        #  Files created by this script
                        #+ will have 600 permissions.

OUTFILE=decrypted.txt   #  Results output to file "decrypted.txt"
                        #+ which can only be read/written
                        #  by invoker of script (or root).

cat "$@" | tr 'a-zA-Z' 'n-za-mN-ZA-M' > $OUTFILE 
#    ^^ Input from stdin or a file.   ^^^^^^^^^^ Output redirected to file. 

exit 0

**rdev**

Get info about or make changes to root device, swap space, or video mode. The functionality of **rdev** has generally been taken over by **lilo**, but **rdev** remains useful for setting up a ram disk. This is a dangerous command, if misused.

**Modules**

**lsmod**

List installed kernel modules.

bash$ **lsmod**
Module                  Size  Used by
 autofs                  9456   2 (autoclean)

 soundlow                 464   0 \[sound\]
 soundcore               2800   6 \[sb sound\]
 ds                      6448   2 \[serial\_cs\]

 pcmcia\_core            45984   0 \[serial\_cs ds i82365\]
	      

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Doing a **cat /proc/modules** gives the same information.

**insmod**

Force installation of a kernel module (use **modprobe** instead, when possible). Must be invoked as _root_.

**rmmod**

Force unloading of a kernel module. Must be invoked as _root_.

**modprobe**

Module loader that is normally invoked automatically in a startup script. Must be invoked as _root_.

**depmod**

Creates module dependency file. Usually invoked from a startup script.

**modinfo**

Output information about a loadable module.

bash$ **modinfo hid**
filename:    /lib/modules/2.4.20-6/kernel/drivers/usb/hid.o
 description: "USB HID support drivers"
 author:      "Andreas Gal, Vojtech Pavlik <vojtech@suse.cz>"
 license:     "GPL"
	      

**Miscellaneous**

**env**

Runs a program or script with certain [environmental variables](#ENVREF) set or changed (without changing the overall system environment). The \[varname=xxx\] permits changing the environmental variable varname for the duration of the script. With no options specified, this command lists all the environmental variable settings. [\[96\]](#FTN.AEN16975)

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The first line of a script (the "sha-bang" line) may use **env** when the path to the shell or interpreter is unknown.

#! /usr/bin/env perl

print "This Perl script will run,\\n";
print "even when I don't know where to find Perl.\\n";

# Good for portable cross-platform scripts,
# where the Perl binaries may not be in the expected place.
# Thanks, S.C.

Or even ...

#!/bin/env bash
# Queries the $PATH enviromental variable for the location of bash.
# Therefore ...
# This script will run where Bash is not in its usual place, in /bin.
...

**ldd**

Show shared lib dependencies for an executable file.

bash$ **ldd /bin/ls**
libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x4000c000)
/lib/ld-linux.so.2 => /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x80000000)

**watch**

Run a command repeatedly, at specified time intervals.

The default is two-second intervals, but this may be changed with the \-n option.

watch -n 5 tail /var/log/messages
# Shows tail end of system log, /var/log/messages, every five seconds.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Unfortunately, [piping](#PIPEREF) the output of **watch command** to [grep](#GREPREF) does not work.

**strip**

Remove the debugging symbolic references from an executable binary. This decreases its size, but makes debugging it impossible.

This command often occurs in a [Makefile](#MAKEFILEREF), but rarely in a shell script.

**nm**

List symbols in an unstripped compiled binary.

**xrandr**

Command-line tool for manipulating the root window of the screen.

**Example 17-11. _Backlight_: changes the brightness of the (laptop) screen backlight**

#!/bin/bash
# backlight.sh
# reldate 02dec2011

17.1. Analyzing a System Script
===============================

Using our knowledge of administrative commands, let us examine a system script. One of the shortest and simplest to understand scripts is "killall," [\[97\]](#FTN.AEN17079) used to suspend running processes at system shutdown.

**Example 17-12. _killall_, from /etc/rc.d/init.d**

#!/bin/sh

# --> Comments added by the author of this document marked by "# -->".

# --> This is part of the 'rc' script package
# --> by Miquel van Smoorenburg, <miquels@drinkel.nl.mugnet.org>.

# --> This particular script seems to be Red Hat / FC specific
# --> (may not be present in other distributions).

#  Bring down all unneeded services that are still running
#+ (there shouldn't be any, so this is just a sanity check)

for i in /var/lock/subsys/\*; do
        # --> Standard for/in loop, but since "do" is on same line,
        # --> it is necessary to add ";".
        # Check if the script is there.
        \[ ! -f $i \] && continue
        # --> This is a clever use of an "and list", equivalent to:
        # --> if \[ ! -f "$i" \]; then continue

        # Get the subsystem name.
        subsys=${i#/var/lock/subsys/}
        # --> Match variable name, which, in this case, is the file name.
        # --> This is the exact equivalent of subsys=\`basename $i\`.
	
        # -->  It gets it from the lock file name
        # -->+ (if there is a lock file,
        # -->+ that's proof the process has been running).
        # -->  See the "lockfile" entry, above.


        # Bring the subsystem down.
        if \[ -f /etc/rc.d/init.d/$subsys.init \]; then
           /etc/rc.d/init.d/$subsys.init stop
        else
           /etc/rc.d/init.d/$subsys stop
        # -->  Suspend running jobs and daemons.
        # -->  Note that "stop" is a positional parameter,
        # -->+ not a shell builtin.
        fi
done

That wasn't so bad. Aside from a little fancy footwork with variable matching, there is no new material there.

**Exercise 1.** In /etc/rc.d/init.d, analyze the **halt** script. It is a bit longer than **killall**, but similar in concept. Make a copy of this script somewhere in your home directory and experiment with it (do _not_ run it as _root_). Do a simulated run with the \-vn flags (**sh -vn scriptname**). Add extensive comments. Change the commands to [echos](#ECHOREF).

**Exercise 2.** Look at some of the more complex scripts in /etc/rc.d/init.d. Try to understand at least portions of them. Follow the above procedure to analyze them. For some additional insight, you might also examine the file sysvinitfiles in /usr/share/doc/initscripts-?.??, which is part of the "initscripts" documentation.

Part 5. Advanced Topics
=======================

At this point, we are ready to delve into certain of the difficult and unusual aspects of scripting. Along the way, we will attempt to "push the envelope" in various ways and examine _boundary conditions_ (what happens when we move into uncharted territory?).

Chapter 18. Regular Expressions
===============================

Â 

_

_. . . the intellectual activity associated with software development is largely one of gaining insight._

_\--Stowe Boyd_

_

To fully utilize the power of shell scripting, you need to master Regular Expressions. Certain commands and utilities commonly used in scripts, such as [grep](#GREPREF), [expr](#EXPRREF), [sed](#SEDREF) and [awk](#AWKREF), interpret and use REs. As of [version 3](#BASH3REF), Bash has acquired its own [RE-match operator](#REGEXMATCHREF): **\=~**.

* * *

18.1. A Brief Introduction to Regular Expressions
=================================================

An expression is a string of characters. Those characters having an interpretation above and beyond their literal meaning are called _metacharacters_. A quote symbol, for example, may denote speech by a person, _ditto_, or a meta-meaning [\[98\]](#FTN.AEN17134) for the symbols that follow. Regular Expressions are sets of characters and/or metacharacters that match (or specify) patterns.

A Regular Expression contains one or more of the following:

*   _A character set_. These are the characters retaining their literal meaning. The simplest type of Regular Expression consists _only_ of a character set, with no metacharacters.
    
*   _An anchor_. These designate (_anchor_) the position in the line of text that the RE is to match. For example, ^, and $ are anchors.
    
*   _Modifiers_. These expand or narrow (_modify_) the range of text the RE is to match. Modifiers include the asterisk, brackets, and the backslash.
    

The main uses for Regular Expressions (_RE_s) are text searches and string manipulation. An RE _matches_ a single character or a set of characters -- a string or a part of a string.

*   The asterisk -- \* -- matches any number of repeats of the character string or RE preceding it, including _zero_ instances.
    
    "1133\*" matches _11 + one or more 3's_: _113_, _1133_, _1133333_, and so forth.
    
*   The _dot_ -- . -- matches any one character, except a newline. [\[99\]](#FTN.AEN17189)
    
    "13." matches _13 + at least one of any character (including a space)_: _1133_, _11333_, but not _13_ (additional character missing).
    
    See [Example 16-18](#CWSOLVER) for a demonstration of _dot single-character_ matching.
    
*   The caret -- ^ -- matches the beginning of a line, but sometimes, depending on context, negates the meaning of a set of characters in an RE.
    
*   The dollar sign -- $ -- at the end of an RE matches the end of a line.
    
    "XXX$" matches XXX at the end of a line.
    
    "^$" matches blank lines.
    
*   Brackets -- \[...\] -- enclose a set of characters to match in a single RE.
    
    "\[xyz\]" matches any one of the characters _x_, _y_, or _z_.
    
    "\[c-n\]" matches any one of the characters in the range _c_ to _n_.
    
    "\[B-Pk-y\]" matches any one of the characters in the ranges _B_ to _P_ and _k_ to _y_.
    
    "\[a-z0-9\]" matches any single lowercase letter or any digit.
    
    "\[^b-d\]" matches any character _except_ those in the range _b_ to _d_. This is an instance of ^ negating or inverting the meaning of the following RE (taking on a role similar to ! in a different context).
    
    Combined sequences of bracketed characters match common word patterns. "\[Yy\]\[Ee\]\[Ss\]" matches _yes_, _Yes_, _YES_, _yEs_, and so forth. "\[0-9\]\[0-9\]\[0-9\]-\[0-9\]\[0-9\]-\[0-9\]\[0-9\]\[0-9\]\[0-9\]" matches any Social Security number.
    
*   The backslash -- \\ -- [escapes](#ESCP) a special character, which means that character gets interpreted literally (and is therefore no longer _special_).
    
    A "\\$" reverts back to its literal meaning of "$", rather than its RE meaning of end-of-line. Likewise a "\\\\" has the literal meaning of "\\".
    
*   [Escaped](#ESCP) "angle brackets" -- \\<...\\> -- mark word boundaries.
    
    The angle brackets must be escaped, since otherwise they have only their literal character meaning.
    
    "\\<the\\>" matches the word "the," but not the words "them," "there," "other," etc.
    
    bash$ **cat textfile**
    This is line 1, of which there is only one instance.
     This is the only instance of line 2.
     This is line 3, another line.
     This is line 4.
    
    bash$ **grep 'the' textfile**
    This is line 1, of which there is only one instance.
     This is the only instance of line 2.
     This is line 3, another line.
    
    bash$ **grep '\\<the\\>' textfile**
    This is the only instance of line 2.
    	      
    

The only way to be certain that a particular RE works is to test it.

TEST FILE: tstfile                          # No match.
                                            # No match.
Run   grep "1133\*"  on this file.           # Match.
                                            # No match.
                                            # No match.
This line contains the number 113.          # Match.
This line contains the number 13.           # No match.
This line contains the number 133.          # No match.
This line contains the number 1133.         # Match.
This line contains the number 113312.       # Match.
This line contains the number 1112.         # No match.
This line contains the number 113312312.    # Match.
This line contains no numbers at all.       # No match.

bash$ **grep "1133\*" tstfile**
Run   grep "1133\*"  on this file.           # Match.
 This line contains the number 113.          # Match.
 This line contains the number 1133.         # Match.
 This line contains the number 113312.       # Match.
 This line contains the number 113312312.    # Match.
	      

*   **Extended REs.** Additional metacharacters added to the basic set. Used in [egrep](#EGREPREF), [awk](#AWKREF), and [Perl](#PERLREF).
    
*   The question mark -- ? -- matches zero or one of the previous RE. It is generally used for matching single characters.
    
*   The plus -- + -- matches one or more of the previous RE. It serves a role similar to the \*, but does _not_ match zero occurrences.
    
    \# GNU versions of sed and awk can use "+",
    # but it needs to be escaped.
    
    echo a111b | sed -ne '/a1\\+b/p'
    echo a111b | grep 'a1\\+b'
    echo a111b | gawk '/a1+b/'
    # All of above are equivalent.
    
    # Thanks, S.C.
    
*   [Escaped](#ESCP) "curly brackets" -- \\{ \\} -- indicate the number of occurrences of a preceding RE to match.
    
    It is necessary to escape the curly brackets since they have only their literal character meaning otherwise. This usage is technically not part of the basic RE set.
    
    "\[0-9\]\\{5\\}" matches exactly five digits (characters in the range of 0 to 9).
    
    ![Note](../images/note.gif)
    
    Curly brackets are not available as an RE in the "classic" (non-POSIX compliant) version of [awk](#AWKREF). However, the GNU extended version of _awk_, **gawk**, has the \--re-interval option that permits them (without being escaped).
    
    bash$ **echo 2222 | gawk --re-interval '/2{3}/'**
    2222
    	      
    
    **Perl** and some **egrep** versions do not require escaping the curly brackets.
    
*   Parentheses -- **( )** -- enclose a group of REs. They are useful with the following "|" operator and in [substring extraction](#EXPRPAREN) using [expr](#EXPRREF).
    
*   The -- **|** -- "or" RE operator matches any of a set of alternate characters.
    
    bash$ **egrep 're(a|e)d' misc.txt**
    People who read seem to be better informed than those who do not.
     The clarinet produces sound by the vibration of its reed.
    	      
    

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Some versions of **sed**, **ed**, and **ex** support escaped versions of the extended Regular Expressions described above, as do the GNU utilities.

*   **POSIX Character Classes.** **\[:class:\]**
    
    This is an alternate method of specifying a range of characters to match.
    
*   **\[:alnum:\]** matches alphabetic or numeric characters. This is equivalent to **A-Za-z0-9**.
    
*   **\[:alpha:\]** matches alphabetic characters. This is equivalent to **A-Za-z**.
    
*   **\[:blank:\]** matches a space or a tab.
    
*   **\[:cntrl:\]** matches control characters.
    
*   **\[:digit:\]** matches (decimal) digits. This is equivalent to **0-9**.
    
*   **\[:graph:\]** (graphic printable characters). Matches characters in the range of [ASCII](#ASCIIDEF) 33 - 126. This is the same as **\[:print:\]**, below, but excluding the space character.
    
*   **\[:lower:\]** matches lowercase alphabetic characters. This is equivalent to **a-z**.
    
*   **\[:print:\]** (printable characters). Matches characters in the range of ASCII 32 - 126. This is the same as **\[:graph:\]**, above, but adding the space character.
    
*   **\[:space:\]** matches whitespace characters (space and horizontal tab).
    
*   **\[:upper:\]** matches uppercase alphabetic characters. This is equivalent to **A-Z**.
    
*   **\[:xdigit:\]** matches hexadecimal digits. This is equivalent to **0-9A-Fa-f**.
    
    ![Important](../images/important.gif)
    
    POSIX character classes generally require quoting or [double brackets](#DBLBRACKETS) (\[\[ \]\]).
    
    bash$ **grep \[\[:digit:\]\] test.file**
    abc=723
    	      
    
    \# ...
    if \[\[ $arow =~ \[\[:digit:\]\] \]\]   #  Numerical input?
    then       #  POSIX char class
      if \[\[ $acol =~ \[\[:alpha:\]\] \]\] # Number followed by a letter? Illegal!
    # ...
    # From ktour.sh example script.
    
    These character classes may even be used with [globbing](#GLOBBINGREF), to a limited extent.
    
    bash$ **ls -l ?\[\[:digit:\]\]\[\[:digit:\]\]?**
    \-rw-rw-r--    1 bozo  bozo         0 Aug 21 14:47 a33b
    	      
    
    POSIX character classes are used in [Example 16-21](#EX49) and [Example 16-22](#LOWERCASE).
    

[Sed](#SEDREF), [awk](#AWKREF), and [Perl](#PERLREF), used as filters in scripts, take REs as arguments when "sifting" or transforming files or I/O streams. See [Example A-12](#BEHEAD) and [Example A-16](#TREE) for illustrations of this.

The standard reference on this complex topic is Friedl's _Mastering Regular Expressions_. _Sed & Awk_, by Dougherty and Robbins, also gives a very lucid treatment of REs. See the [_Bibliography_](#BIBLIO) for more information on these books.

* * *

18.2. Globbing
==============

Bash itself cannot recognize Regular Expressions. Inside scripts, it is commands and utilities -- such as [sed](#SEDREF) and [awk](#AWKREF) -- that interpret RE's.

Bash _does_ carry out _filename expansion_ [\[100\]](#FTN.AEN17572) -- a process known as _globbing_ -- but this does _not_ use the standard RE set. Instead, globbing recognizes and expands _wild cards_. Globbing interprets the standard wild card characters [\[101\]](#FTN.AEN17581) -- [\*](#ASTERISKREF) and [?](#WILDCARDQU), character lists in square brackets, and certain other special characters (such as ^ for negating the sense of a match). There are important limitations on wild card characters in globbing, however. Strings containing _\*_ will not match filenames that start with a dot, as, for example, [.bashrc](#SAMPLE-BASHRC). [\[102\]](#FTN.AEN17592) Likewise, the _?_ has a different meaning in globbing than as part of an RE.

Bash performs filename expansion on unquoted command-line arguments. The [echo](#ECHOREF) command demonstrates this.

bash$ **echo \***
a.1 b.1 c.1 t2.sh test1.txt

bash$ **echo t\***
t2.sh test1.txt

bash$ **echo t?.sh**
t2.sh
	      

![Note](../images/note.gif)

It is possible to modify the way Bash interprets special characters in globbing. A **set -f** command disables globbing, and the nocaseglob and nullglob options to [shopt](#SHOPTREF) change globbing behavior.

See also [Example 11-5](#LISTGLOB).

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Filenames with embedded [whitespace](#WHITESPACEREF) can cause _globbing_ to choke. [David Wheeler](http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html) shows how to avoid many such pitfalls.

IFS="$(printf '\\n\\t')"   # Remove space.

#  Correct glob use:
#  Always use for-loop, prefix glob, check if exists file.
for file in ./\* ; do         # Use ./\* ... NEVER bare \*
  if \[ -e "$file" \] ; then   # Check whether file exists.
     COMMAND ... "$file" ...
  fi
done

Chapter 19. Here Documents
==========================

Â 

_

_Here and now, boys._

_\--Aldous Huxley, _Island__

_

A _here document_ is a special-purpose code block. It uses a form of [I/O redirection](#IOREDIRREF) to feed a command list to an interactive program or a command, such as [ftp](#FTPREF), [cat](#CATREF), or the _ex_ text editor.

COMMAND <<InputComesFromHERE
...
...
...
InputComesFromHERE

A _limit string_ delineates (frames) the command list. The special symbol << precedes the limit string. This has the effect of redirecting the output of a command block into the stdin of the program or command. It is similar to **interactive-program < command-file**, where command-file contains

command #1
command #2
...

The _here document_ equivalent looks like this:

interactive-program <<LimitString
command #1
command #2
...
LimitString

Choose a _limit string_ sufficiently unusual that it will not occur anywhere in the command list and confuse matters.

Note that _here documents_ may sometimes be used to good effect with non-interactive utilities and commands, such as, for example, [wall](#WALLREF).

**Example 19-1. _broadcast_: Sends message to everyone logged in**

#!/bin/bash

wall <<zzz23EndOfMessagezzz23
E-mail your noontime orders for pizza to the system administrator.
    (Add an extra dollar for anchovy or mushroom topping.)
# Additional message text goes here.
# Note: 'wall' prints comment lines.
zzz23EndOfMessagezzz23

# Could have been done more efficiently by
#         wall <message-file
#  However, embedding the message template in a script
#+ is a quick-and-dirty one-off solution.

exit

Even such unlikely candidates as the _vi_ text editor lend themselves to _here documents_.

**Example 19-2. _dummyfile_: Creates a 2-line dummy file**

#!/bin/bash

# Noninteractive use of 'vi' to edit a file.
# Emulates 'sed'.

E\_BADARGS=85

if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` filename"
  exit $E\_BADARGS
fi

TARGETFILE=$1

# Insert 2 lines in file, then save.
#--------Begin here document-----------#
vi $TARGETFILE <<x23LimitStringx23
i
This is line 1 of the example file.
This is line 2 of the example file.
^\[
ZZ
x23LimitStringx23
#----------End here document-----------#

#  Note that ^\[ above is a literal escape
#+ typed by Control-V <Esc>.

#  Bram Moolenaar points out that this may not work with 'vim'
#+ because of possible problems with terminal interaction.

exit

The above script could just as effectively have been implemented with **ex**, rather than **vi**. _Here documents_ containing a list of **ex** commands are common enough to form their own category, known as _ex scripts_.

#!/bin/bash
#  Replace all instances of "Smith" with "Jones"
#+ in files with a ".txt" filename suffix. 

ORIGINAL=Smith
REPLACEMENT=Jones

for word in $(fgrep -l $ORIGINAL \*.txt)
do
  # -------------------------------------
  ex $word <<EOF
  :%s/$ORIGINAL/$REPLACEMENT/g
  :wq
EOF
  # :%s is the "ex" substitution command.
  # :wq is write-and-quit.
  # -------------------------------------
done

Analogous to "ex scripts" are _cat scripts_.

**Example 19-3. Multi-line message using _cat_**

#!/bin/bash

#  'echo' is fine for printing single line messages,
#+  but somewhat problematic for for message blocks.
#   A 'cat' here document overcomes this limitation.

cat <<End-of-message
-------------------------------------
This is line 1 of the message.
This is line 2 of the message.
This is line 3 of the message.
This is line 4 of the message.
This is the last line of the message.
-------------------------------------
End-of-message

#  Replacing line 7, above, with
#+   cat > $Newfile <<End-of-message
#+       ^^^^^^^^^^
#+ writes the output to the file $Newfile, rather than to stdout.

exit 0


#--------------------------------------------
# Code below disabled, due to "exit 0" above.

# S.C. points out that the following also works.
echo "-------------------------------------
This is line 1 of the message.
This is line 2 of the message.
This is line 3 of the message.
This is line 4 of the message.
This is the last line of the message.
-------------------------------------"
# However, text may not include double quotes unless they are escaped.

The \- option to mark a here document limit string (**<<-LimitString**) suppresses leading tabs (but not spaces) in the output. This may be useful in making a script more readable.

**Example 19-4. Multi-line message, with tabs suppressed**

#!/bin/bash
# Same as previous example, but...

#  The - option to a here document <<-
#+ suppresses leading tabs in the body of the document,
#+ but \*not\* spaces.

cat <<-ENDOFMESSAGE
	This is line 1 of the message.

A _here document_ supports parameter and command substitution. It is therefore possible to pass different parameters to the body of the here document, changing its output accordingly.

**Example 19-5. Here document with replaceable parameters**

#!/bin/bash
# Another 'cat' here document, using parameter substitution.

# Try it with no command-line parameters,   ./scriptname
# Try it with one command-line parameter,   ./scriptname Mortimer
# Try it with one two-word quoted command-line parameter,
#                           ./scriptname "Mortimer Jones"

CMDLINEPARAM=1     #  Expect at least command-line parameter.

if \[ $# -ge $CMDLINEPARAM \]
then
  NAME=$1          #  If more than one command-line param,
                   #+ then just take the first.
else
  NAME="John Doe"  #  Default, if no command-line parameter.
fi  

RESPONDENT="the author of this fine script"  
  

cat <<Endofmessage

Hello, there, $NAME.
Greetings to you, $NAME, from $RESPONDENT.

# This comment shows up in the output (why?).

Endofmessage

# Note that the blank lines show up in the output.
# So does the comment.

exit

This is a useful script containing a _here document_ with parameter substitution.

**Example 19-6. Upload a file pair to _Sunsite_ incoming directory**

#!/bin/bash
# upload.sh

#  Upload file pair (Filename.lsm, Filename.tar.gz)
#+ to incoming directory at Sunsite/UNC (ibiblio.org).
#  Filename.tar.gz is the tarball itself.
#  Filename.lsm is the descriptor file.
#  Sunsite requires "lsm" file, otherwise will bounce contributions.


E\_ARGERROR=85

if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` Filename-to-upload"
  exit $E\_ARGERROR
fi

Server="ibiblio.org"

#  These need not be hard-coded into script,
#+ but may instead be changed to command-line argument.

Password="your.e-mail.address"   # Change above to suit.

ftp -n $Server <<End-Of-Session
# -n option disables auto-logon

user anonymous "$Password"       #  If this doesn't work, then try:

Quoting or escaping the "limit string" at the head of a here document disables parameter substitution within its body. The reason for this is that _quoting/escaping the limit string_ effectively [escapes](#ESCP) the $, \`, and \\ [special characters](#SCHARLIST), and causes them to be interpreted literally. (Thank you, Allen Halsey, for pointing this out.)

**Example 19-7. Parameter substitution turned off**

#!/bin/bash
#  A 'cat' here-document, but with parameter substitution disabled.

NAME="John Doe"
RESPONDENT="the author of this fine script"  

cat <<'Endofmessage'

Hello, there, $NAME.
Greetings to you, $NAME, from $RESPONDENT.

Endofmessage

#   No parameter substitution when the "limit string" is quoted or escaped.
#   Either of the following at the head of the here document would have
#+  the same effect.
#   cat <<"Endofmessage"
#   cat <<\\Endofmessage



#   And, likewise:

cat <<"SpecialCharTest"

Directory listing would follow
if limit string were not quoted.
\`ls -l\`

Arithmetic expansion would take place
if limit string were not quoted.
$((5 + 3))

A a single backslash would echo
if limit string were not quoted.
\\\\

SpecialCharTest


exit

Disabling parameter substitution permits outputting literal text. Generating scripts or even program code is one use for this.

**Example 19-8. A script that generates another script**

#!/bin/bash
# generate-script.sh
# Based on an idea by Albert Reiner.

OUTFILE=generated.sh         # Name of the file to generate.


# -----------------------------------------------------------
# 'Here document containing the body of the generated script.
(
cat <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

echo "This is a generated shell script."
#  Note that since we are inside a subshell,
#+ we can't access variables in the "outside" script.

echo "Generated file will be named: $OUTFILE"
#  Above line will not work as normally expected
#+ because parameter expansion has been disabled.
#  Instead, the result is literal output.

a=7
b=3

let "c = $a \* $b"
echo "c = $c"

exit 0
EOF
) > $OUTFILE
# -----------------------------------------------------------

#  Quoting the 'limit string' prevents variable expansion
#+ within the body of the above 'here document.'
#  This permits outputting literal strings in the output file.

if \[ -f "$OUTFILE" \]
then
  chmod 755 $OUTFILE
  # Make the generated file executable.
else
  echo "Problem in creating file: \\"$OUTFILE\\""
fi

#  This method also works for generating
#+ C programs, Perl programs, Python programs, Makefiles,
#+ and the like.

exit 0

It is possible to set a variable from the output of a here document. This is actually a devious form of [command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF).

variable=$(cat <<SETVAR
This variable
runs over multiple lines.
SETVAR
)

echo "$variable"

A here document can supply input to a function in the same script.

**Example 19-9. Here documents and functions**

#!/bin/bash
# here-function.sh

GetPersonalData ()
{
  read firstname
  read lastname
  read address
  read city 
  read state 
  read zipcode
} # This certainly appears to be an interactive function, but . . .


# Supply input to the above function.
GetPersonalData <<RECORD001
Bozo
Bozeman
2726 Nondescript Dr.
Bozeman
MT
21226
RECORD001


echo
echo "$firstname $lastname"
echo "$address"
echo "$city, $state $zipcode"
echo

exit 0

It is possible to use : as a dummy command accepting output from a here document. This, in effect, creates an "anonymous" here document.

**Example 19-10. "Anonymous" Here Document**

#!/bin/bash

: <<TESTVARIABLES
${HOSTNAME?}${USER?}${MAIL?}  # Print error message if one of the variables not set.
TESTVARIABLES

exit $?

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

A variation of the above technique permits "commenting out" blocks of code.

**Example 19-11. Commenting out a block of code**

#!/bin/bash
# commentblock.sh

: <<COMMENTBLOCK
echo "This line will not echo."
This is a comment line missing the "#" prefix.
This is another comment line missing the "#" prefix.

&\*@!!++=
The above line will cause no error message,
because the Bash interpreter will ignore it.
COMMENTBLOCK

echo "Exit value of above \\"COMMENTBLOCK\\" is $?."   # 0
# No error shown.
echo


#  The above technique also comes in useful for commenting out
#+ a block of working code for debugging purposes.
#  This saves having to put a "#" at the beginning of each line,
#+ then having to go back and delete each "#" later.
#  Note that the use of of colon, above, is optional.

echo "Just before commented-out code block."
#  The lines of code between the double-dashed lines will not execute.
#  ===================================================================
: <<DEBUGXXX
for file in \*
do
 cat "$file"
done
DEBUGXXX
#  ===================================================================
echo "Just after commented-out code block."

exit 0



######################################################################
#  Note, however, that if a bracketed variable is contained within
#+ the commented-out code block,
#+ then this could cause problems.
#  for example:


#/!/bin/bash

  : <<COMMENTBLOCK
  echo "This line will not echo."
  &\*@!!++=
  ${foo\_bar\_bazz?}
  $(rm -rf /tmp/foobar/)
  $(touch my\_build\_directory/cups/Makefile)
COMMENTBLOCK


$ sh commented-bad.sh
commented-bad.sh: line 3: foo\_bar\_bazz: parameter null or not set

# The remedy for this is to strong-quote the 'COMMENTBLOCK' in line 49, above.

  : <<'COMMENTBLOCK'

# Thank you, Kurt Pfeifle, for pointing this out.

Yet another twist of this nifty trick makes "self-documenting" scripts possible.

**Example 19-12. A self-documenting script**

#!/bin/bash
# self-document.sh: self-documenting script
# Modification of "colm.sh".

DOC\_REQUEST=70

if \[ "$1" = "-h"  -o "$1" = "--help" \]     # Request help.
then
  echo; echo "Usage: $0 \[directory-name\]"; echo
  sed --silent -e '/DOCUMENTATIONXX$/,/^DOCUMENTATIONXX$/p' "$0" |
  sed -e '/DOCUMENTATIONXX$/d'; exit $DOC\_REQUEST; fi


: <<DOCUMENTATIONXX
List the statistics of a specified directory in tabular format.
---------------------------------------------------------------
The command-line parameter gives the directory to be listed.
If no directory specified or directory specified cannot be read,
then list the current working directory.

DOCUMENTATIONXX

if \[ -z "$1" -o ! -r "$1" \]
then
  directory=.
else
  directory="$1"
fi  

echo "Listing of "$directory":"; echo
(printf "PERMISSIONS LINKS OWNER GROUP SIZE MONTH DAY HH:MM PROG-NAME\\n" \\
; ls -l "$directory" | sed 1d) | column -t

exit 0

Using a [cat script](#CATSCRIPTREF) is an alternate way of accomplishing this.

DOC\_REQUEST=70

if \[ "$1" = "-h"  -o "$1" = "--help" \]     # Request help.
then                                       # Use a "cat script" . . .
  cat <<DOCUMENTATIONXX
List the statistics of a specified directory in tabular format.
---------------------------------------------------------------
The command-line parameter gives the directory to be listed.
If no directory specified or directory specified cannot be read,
then list the current working directory.

DOCUMENTATIONXX
exit $DOC\_REQUEST
fi

See also [Example A-28](#ISSPAMMER2), [Example A-40](#PETALS), [Example A-41](#QKY), and [Example A-42](#NIM) for more examples of self-documenting scripts.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Here documents create temporary files, but these files are deleted after opening and are not accessible to any other process.

bash$ **bash -c 'lsof -a -p $$ -d0' << EOF**
\> **EOF**
lsof    1213 bozo    0r   REG    3,5    0 30386 /tmp/t1213-0-sh (deleted)
	      

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Some utilities will not work inside a _here document_.

![Warning](../images/warning.gif)

The closing _limit string_, on the final line of a here document, must start in the _first_ character position. There can be _no leading whitespace_. Trailing whitespace after the limit string likewise causes unexpected behavior. The whitespace prevents the limit string from being recognized. [\[103\]](#FTN.AEN17822)

#!/bin/bash

echo "----------------------------------------------------------------------"

cat <<LimitString
echo "This is line 1 of the message inside the here document."
echo "This is line 2 of the message inside the here document."
echo "This is the final line of the message inside the here document."
     LimitString
#^^^^Indented limit string. Error! This script will not behave as expected.

echo "----------------------------------------------------------------------"

#  These comments are outside the 'here document',
#+ and should not echo.

echo "Outside the here document."

exit 0

echo "This line had better not echo."  # Follows an 'exit' command.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Some people very cleverly use a single ! as a limit string. But, that's not necessarily a good idea.

\# This works.
cat <<!
Hello!
! Three more exclamations !!!
!


# But . . .
cat <<!
Hello!
Single exclamation point follows!
!
!
# Crashes with an error message.


# However, the following will work.
cat <<EOF
Hello!
Single exclamation point follows!
!
EOF
# It's safer to use a multi-character limit string.

For those tasks too complex for a _here document_, consider using the _expect_ scripting language, which was specifically designed for feeding input into interactive programs.

19.1. Here Strings
==================

> AÂ _here string_Â canÂ beÂ consideredÂ asÂ aÂ stripped-downÂ formÂ ofÂ aÂ _here document_.  
> ItÂ consistsÂ ofÂ nothingÂ moreÂ thanÂ **COMMAND <<< $WORD**,  
> whereÂ $WORDÂ isÂ expandedÂ andÂ fedÂ toÂ theÂ stdinÂ ofÂ **COMMAND**.  
> Â Â Â Â Â 

As a simple example, consider this alternative to the [echo-grep](#ECHOGREPREF) construction.

\# Instead of:
if echo "$VAR" | grep -q txt   # if \[\[ $VAR = \*txt\* \]\]
# etc.

# Try:
if grep -q "txt" <<< "$VAR"
then   #         ^^^
   echo "$VAR contains the substring sequence \\"txt\\""
fi
# Thank you, Sebastian Kaminski, for the suggestion.

Or, in combination with [read](#READREF):

String="This is a string of words."

read -r -a Words <<< "$String"
#  The -a option to "read"
#+ assigns the resulting values to successive members of an array.

echo "First word in String is:    ${Words\[0\]}"   # This
echo "Second word in String is:   ${Words\[1\]}"   # is
echo "Third word in String is:    ${Words\[2\]}"   # a
echo "Fourth word in String is:   ${Words\[3\]}"   # string
echo "Fifth word in String is:    ${Words\[4\]}"   # of
echo "Sixth word in String is:    ${Words\[5\]}"   # words.
echo "Seventh word in String is:  ${Words\[6\]}"   # (null)
                                                 # Past end of $String.

# Thank you, Francisco Lobo, for the suggestion.

It is, of course, possible to feed the output of a _here string_ into the stdin of a [loop](#LOOPREF00).

\# As Seamus points out . . .

ArrayVar=( element0 element1 element2 {A..D} )

while read element ; do
  echo "$element" 1>&2
done <<< $(echo ${ArrayVar\[\*\]})

# element0 element1 element2 A B C D

Chapter 20. I/O Redirection
===========================

There are always three default _files_ [\[104\]](#FTN.AEN17884) open, stdin (the keyboard), stdout (the screen), and stderr (error messages output to the screen). These, and any other open files, can be redirected. Redirection simply means capturing output from a file, command, program, script, or even code block within a script (see [Example 3-1](#EX8) and [Example 3-2](#RPMCHECK)) and sending it as input to another file, command, program, or script.

Each open file gets assigned a file descriptor. [\[105\]](#FTN.AEN17894) The file descriptors for stdin, stdout, and stderr are 0, 1, and 2, respectively. For opening additional files, there remain descriptors 3 to 9. It is sometimes useful to assign one of these additional file descriptors to stdin, stdout, or stderr as a temporary duplicate link. [\[106\]](#FTN.AEN17906) This simplifies restoration to normal after complex redirection and reshuffling (see [Example 20-1](#REDIR1)).

   COMMAND\_OUTPUT >
      # Redirect stdout to a file.
      # Creates the file if not present, otherwise overwrites it.

      ls -lR > dir-tree.list
      # Creates a file containing a listing of the directory tree.

   : > filename
      # The > truncates file "filename" to zero length.
      # If file not present, creates zero-length file (same effect as 'touch').
      # The : serves as a dummy placeholder, producing no output.

   > filename    
      # The > truncates file "filename" to zero length.
      # If file not present, creates zero-length file (same effect as 'touch').
      # (Same result as ": >", above, but this does not work with some shells.)

   COMMAND\_OUTPUT >>
      # Redirect stdout to a file.
      # Creates the file if not present, otherwise appends to it.


      # Single-line redirection commands (affect only the line they are on):
      # --------------------------------------------------------------------

   1>filename
      # Redirect stdout to file "filename."
   1>>filename
      # Redirect and append stdout to file "filename."
   2>filename
      # Redirect stderr to file "filename."
   2>>filename
      # Redirect and append stderr to file "filename."
   &>filename
      # Redirect both stdout and stderr to file "filename."
      # This operator is now functional, as of Bash 4, final release.

   M>N
     # "M" is a file descriptor, which defaults to 1, if not explicitly set.
     # "N" is a filename.
     # File descriptor "M" is redirect to file "N."

#  Because stderr is redirected to the file,
#+ any error messages will also be there.

#  Note, however, that the following does \*not\* give the same result.
ls -yz 2>&1 >> command.log
#  Outputs an error message, but does not write to file.
#  More precisely, the command output (in this case, null)
#+ writes to the file, but the error message goes only to stdout.

#  If redirecting both stdout and stderr,
#+ the order of the commands makes a difference.

**Closing File Descriptors**

n<&-

Close input file descriptor _n_.

0<&-, <&-

Close stdin.

n>&-

Close output file descriptor _n_.

1>&-, \>&-

Close stdout.

Child processes inherit open file descriptors. This is why pipes work. To prevent an fd from being inherited, close it.

\# Redirecting only stderr to a pipe.

exec 3>&1                              # Save current "value" of stdout.
ls -l 2>&1 >&3 3>&- | grep bad 3>&-    # Close fd 3 for 'grep' (but not 'ls').
#              ^^^^   ^^^^
exec 3>&-                              # Now close it for the remainder of the script.

# Thanks, S.C.

20.1. Using _exec_
==================

An **exec <filename** command redirects stdin to a file. From that point on, all stdin comes from that file, rather than its normal source (usually keyboard input). This provides a method of reading a file line by line and possibly parsing each line of input using [sed](#SEDREF) and/or [awk](#AWKREF).

**Example 20-1. Redirecting stdin using _exec_**

#!/bin/bash
# Redirecting stdin using 'exec'.


exec 6<&0          # Link file descriptor #6 with stdin.
                   # Saves stdin.

exec < data-file   # stdin replaced by file "data-file"

read a1            # Reads first line of file "data-file".
read a2            # Reads second line of file "data-file."

echo
echo "Following lines read from file."
echo "-------------------------------"
echo $a1
echo $a2

echo; echo; echo

exec 0<&6 6<&-
#  Now restore stdin from fd #6, where it had been saved,
#+ and close fd #6 ( 6<&- ) to free it for other processes to use.
#
# <&6 6<&-    also works.

echo -n "Enter data  "
read b1  # Now "read" functions as expected, reading from normal stdin.
echo "Input read from stdin."
echo "----------------------"
echo "b1 = $b1"

echo

exit 0

Similarly, an **exec >filename** command redirects stdout to a designated file. This sends all command output that would normally go to stdout to that file.

![Important](../images/important.gif)

**exec N > filename** affects the entire script or _current shell_. Redirection in the [PID](#PROCESSIDREF) of the script or shell from that point on has changed. However . . .

**N > filename** affects only the newly-forked process, not the entire script or shell.

Thank you, Ahmed Darwish, for pointing this out.

**Example 20-2. Redirecting stdout using _exec_**

#!/bin/bash
# reassign-stdout.sh

LOGFILE=logfile.txt

exec 6>&1           # Link file descriptor #6 with stdout.
                    # Saves stdout.

exec > $LOGFILE     # stdout replaced with file "logfile.txt".

# ----------------------------------------------------------- #
# All output from commands in this block sent to file $LOGFILE.

echo -n "Logfile: "
date
echo "-------------------------------------"
echo

echo "Output of \\"ls -al\\" command"
echo
ls -al
echo; echo
echo "Output of \\"df\\" command"
echo
df

# ----------------------------------------------------------- #

exec 1>&6 6>&-      # Restore stdout and close file descriptor #6.

echo
echo "== stdout now restored to default == "
echo
ls -al
echo

exit 0

**Example 20-3. Redirecting both stdin and stdout in the same script with _exec_**

#!/bin/bash
# upperconv.sh
# Converts a specified input file to uppercase.

E\_FILE\_ACCESS=70
E\_WRONG\_ARGS=71

if \[ ! -r "$1" \]     # Is specified input file readable?
then
  echo "Can't read from input file!"
  echo "Usage: $0 input-file output-file"
  exit $E\_FILE\_ACCESS
fi                   #  Will exit with same error
                     #+ even if input file ($1) not specified (why?).

if \[ -z "$2" \]
then
  echo "Need to specify output file."
  echo "Usage: $0 input-file output-file"
  exit $E\_WRONG\_ARGS
fi


exec 4<&0
exec < $1            # Will read from input file.

exec 7>&1
exec > $2            # Will write to output file.
                     # Assumes output file writable (add check?).

# -----------------------------------------------
    cat - | tr a-z A-Z   # Uppercase conversion.
#   ^^^^^                # Reads from stdin.
#           ^^^^^^^^^^   # Writes to stdout.
# However, both stdin and stdout were redirected.
# Note that the 'cat' can be omitted.
# -----------------------------------------------

exec 1>&7 7>&-       # Restore stout.
exec 0<&4 4<&-       # Restore stdin.

# After restoration, the following line prints to stdout as expected.
echo "File \\"$1\\" written to \\"$2\\" as uppercase conversion."

exit 0

I/O redirection is a clever way of avoiding the dreaded [inaccessible variables within a subshell](#PARVIS) problem.

**Example 20-4. Avoiding a subshell**

#!/bin/bash
# avoid-subshell.sh
# Suggested by Matthew Walker.

Lines=0

echo

cat myfile.txt | while read line;
                 do {
                   echo $line
                   (( Lines++ ));  #  Incremented values of this variable
                                   #+ inaccessible outside loop.
                                   #  Subshell problem.
                 }
                 done

echo "Number of lines read = $Lines"     # 0
                                         # Wrong!

echo "------------------------"


exec 3<> myfile.txt
while read line <&3
do {
  echo "$line"
  (( Lines++ ));                   #  Incremented values of this variable
                                   #+ accessible outside loop.
                                   #  No subshell, no problem.
}
done
exec 3>&-

echo "Number of lines read = $Lines"     # 8

20.2. Redirecting Code Blocks
=============================

Blocks of code, such as [while](#WHILELOOPREF), [until](#UNTILLOOPREF), and [for](#FORLOOPREF1) loops, even [if/then](#IFTHEN) test blocks can also incorporate redirection of stdin. Even a function may use this form of redirection (see [Example 24-11](#REALNAME)). The < operator at the end of the code block accomplishes this.

**Example 20-5. Redirected _while_ loop**

#!/bin/bash
# redir2.sh

if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  Filename=names.data       # Default, if no filename specified.
else
  Filename=$1
fi  
#+ Filename=${1:-names.data}
#  can replace the above test (parameter substitution).

count=0

echo

while \[ "$name" != Smith \]  # Why is variable $name in quotes?
do
  read name                 # Reads from $Filename, rather than stdin.
  echo $name
  let "count += 1"
done <"$Filename"           # Redirects stdin to file $Filename. 
#    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

echo; echo "$count names read"; echo

exit 0

#  Note that in some older shell scripting languages,
#+ the redirected loop would run as a subshell.
#  Therefore, $count would return 0, the initialized value outside the loop.
#  Bash and ksh avoid starting a subshell \*whenever possible\*,
#+ so that this script, for example, runs correctly.
#  (Thanks to Heiner Steven for pointing this out.)

#  However . . .
#  Bash \*can\* sometimes start a subshell in a PIPED "while-read" loop,
#+ as distinct from a REDIRECTED "while" loop.

abc=hi
echo -e "1\\n2\\n3" | while read l
     do abc="$l"
        echo $abc
     done
echo $abc

#  Thanks, Bruno de Oliveira Schneider, for demonstrating this
#+ with the above snippet of code.
#  And, thanks, Brian Onn, for correcting an annotation error.

**Example 20-6. Alternate form of redirected _while_ loop**

#!/bin/bash

# This is an alternate form of the preceding script.

#  Suggested by Heiner Steven
#+ as a workaround in those situations when a redirect loop
#+ runs as a subshell, and therefore variables inside the loop
# +do not keep their values upon loop termination.


if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  Filename=names.data     # Default, if no filename specified.
else
  Filename=$1
fi  


exec 3<&0                 # Save stdin to file descriptor 3.
exec 0<"$Filename"        # Redirect standard input.

count=0
echo


while \[ "$name" != Smith \]
do
  read name               # Reads from redirected stdin ($Filename).
  echo $name
  let "count += 1"
done                      #  Loop reads from file $Filename
                          #+ because of line 20.

#  The original version of this script terminated the "while" loop with
#+      done <"$Filename" 
#  Exercise:
#  Why is this unnecessary?


exec 0<&3                 # Restore old stdin.
exec 3<&-                 # Close temporary fd 3.

echo; echo "$count names read"; echo

exit 0

**Example 20-7. Redirected _until_ loop**

#!/bin/bash
# Same as previous example, but with "until" loop.

if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  Filename=names.data         # Default, if no filename specified.
else
  Filename=$1
fi  

# while \[ "$name" != Smith \]
until \[ "$name" = Smith \]     # Change  !=  to =.
do
  read name                   # Reads from $Filename, rather than stdin.
  echo $name
done <"$Filename"             # Redirects stdin to file $Filename. 
#    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

# Same results as with "while" loop in previous example.

exit 0

**Example 20-8. Redirected _for_ loop**

#!/bin/bash

if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  Filename=names.data          # Default, if no filename specified.
else
  Filename=$1
fi  

line\_count=\`wc $Filename | awk '{ print $1 }'\`
#           Number of lines in target file.
#
#  Very contrived and kludgy, nevertheless shows that
#+ it's possible to redirect stdin within a "for" loop...
#+ if you're clever enough.
#
# More concise is     line\_count=$(wc -l < "$Filename")


for name in \`seq $line\_count\`  # Recall that "seq" prints sequence of numbers.
# while \[ "$name" != Smith \]   --   more complicated than a "while" loop   --
do
  read name                    # Reads from $Filename, rather than stdin.
  echo $name
  if \[ "$name" = Smith \]       # Need all this extra baggage here.
  then
    break
  fi  
done <"$Filename"              # Redirects stdin to file $Filename. 
#    ^^^^^^^^^^^^

exit 0

We can modify the previous example to also redirect the output of the loop.

**Example 20-9. Redirected _for_ loop (both stdin and stdout redirected)**

#!/bin/bash

if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  Filename=names.data          # Default, if no filename specified.
else
  Filename=$1
fi  

Savefile=$Filename.new         # Filename to save results in.
FinalName=Jonah                # Name to terminate "read" on.

line\_count=\`wc $Filename | awk '{ print $1 }'\`  # Number of lines in target file.


for name in \`seq $line\_count\`
do
  read name
  echo "$name"
  if \[ "$name" = "$FinalName" \]
  then
    break
  fi  
done < "$Filename" > "$Savefile"     # Redirects stdin to file $Filename,
#    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^       and saves it to backup file.

exit 0

**Example 20-10. Redirected _if/then_ test**

#!/bin/bash

if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  Filename=names.data   # Default, if no filename specified.
else
  Filename=$1
fi  

TRUE=1

if \[ "$TRUE" \]          # if true    and   if :   also work.
then
 read name
 echo $name
fi <"$Filename"
#  ^^^^^^^^^^^^

# Reads only first line of file.
# An "if/then" test has no way of iterating unless embedded in a loop.

exit 0

Redirecting the stdout of a code block has the effect of saving its output to a file. See [Example 3-2](#RPMCHECK).

[Here documents](#HEREDOCREF) are a special case of redirected code blocks. That being the case, it should be possible to feed the output of a _here document_ into the stdin for a _while loop_.

  let nr++
  totalSize=$((totalSize+fileSize))   # Or: "let totalSize+=fileSize"
done<<EOF
$(doesOutput)
EOF

echo "$nr files totaling $totalSize bytes"

20.3. Applications
==================

Clever use of I/O redirection permits parsing and stitching together snippets of command output (see [Example 15-7](#READREDIR)). This permits generating report and log files.

**Example 20-12. Logging events**

#!/bin/bash
# logevents.sh
# Author: Stephane Chazelas.
# Used in ABS Guide with permission.

# Event logging to a file.
# Must be run as root (for write access in /var/log).

ROOT\_UID=0     # Only users with $UID 0 have root privileges.
E\_NOTROOT=67   # Non-root exit error.


if \[ "$UID" -ne "$ROOT\_UID" \]
then
  echo "Must be root to run this script."
  exit $E\_NOTROOT
fi  


FD\_DEBUG1=3
FD\_DEBUG2=4
FD\_DEBUG3=5

# === Uncomment one of the two lines below to activate script. ===
# LOG\_EVENTS=1
# LOG\_VARS=1


log()  # Writes time and date to log file.
{
echo "$(date)  $\*" >&7     # This \*appends\* the date to the file.
#     ^^^^^^^  command substitution
                           # See below.
}



case $LOG\_LEVEL in
 1) exec 3>&2         4> /dev/null 5> /dev/null;;
 2) exec 3>&2         4>&2         5> /dev/null;;
 3) exec 3>&2         4>&2         5>&2;;
 \*) exec 3> /dev/null 4> /dev/null 5> /dev/null;;
esac

FD\_LOGVARS=6
if \[\[ $LOG\_VARS \]\]
then exec 6>> /var/log/vars.log
else exec 6> /dev/null                     # Bury output.
fi

FD\_LOGEVENTS=7
if \[\[ $LOG\_EVENTS \]\]
then
  # exec 7 >(exec gawk '{print strftime(), $0}' >> /var/log/event.log)
  # Above line fails in versions of Bash more recent than 2.04. Why?
  exec 7>> /var/log/event.log              # Append to "event.log".
  log                                      # Write time and date.
else exec 7> /dev/null                     # Bury output.
fi

echo "DEBUG3: beginning" >&${FD\_DEBUG3}

ls -l >&5 2>&4                             # command1 >&5 2>&4

echo "Done"                                # command2 

echo "sending mail" >&${FD\_LOGEVENTS}
# Writes "sending mail" to file descriptor #7.


exit 0

Chapter 21. Subshells
=====================

Running a shell script launches a new process, a _subshell_.

**Definition:** A _subshell_ is a [child process](#CHILDREF2) launched by a shell (or _shell script_).

A subshell is a separate instance of the command processor -- the _shell_ that gives you the prompt at the console or in an _xterm_ window. Just as your commands are interpreted at the command-line prompt, similarly does a script [batch-process](#BATCHPROCREF) a list of commands. Each shell script running is, in effect, a subprocess (_child process_) of the [parent](#FORKREF) shell.

A shell script can itself launch subprocesses. These _subshells_ let the script do parallel processing, in effect executing multiple subtasks simultaneously.

#!/bin/bash
# subshell-test.sh

(
# Inside parentheses, and therefore a subshell . . .
while \[ 1 \]   # Endless loop.
do
  echo "Subshell running . . ."
done
)

#  Script will run forever,
#+ or at least until terminated by a Ctl-C.

exit $?  # End of script (but will never get here).



Now, run the script:
sh subshell-test.sh

And, while the script is running, from a different xterm:
ps -ef | grep subshell-test.sh

UID       PID   PPID  C STIME TTY      TIME     CMD
500       2698  2502  0 14:26 pts/4    00:00:00 sh subshell-test.sh
500       2699  2698 21 14:26 pts/4    00:00:24 sh subshell-test.sh

          ^^^^

Analysis:
PID 2698, the script, launched PID 2699, the subshell.

Note: The "UID ..." line would be filtered out by the "grep" command,
but is shown here for illustrative purposes.

In general, an [external command](#EXTERNALREF) in a script [forks off](#FORKREF) a subprocess, [\[107\]](#FTN.AEN18102) whereas a Bash [builtin](#BUILTINREF) does not. For this reason, builtins execute more quickly and use fewer system resources than their external command equivalents.

**Command List within Parentheses**

( command1; command2; command3; ... )

A command list embedded between _parentheses_ runs as a subshell.

Variables in a subshell are _not_ visible outside the block of code in the subshell. They are not accessible to the [parent process](#FORKREF), to the shell that launched the subshell. These are, in effect, variables [local](#LOCALREF) to the _child process_.

**Example 21-1. Variable scope in a subshell**

#!/bin/bash
# subshell.sh

echo

echo "We are outside the subshell."
echo "Subshell level OUTSIDE subshell = $BASH\_SUBSHELL"
# Bash, version 3, adds the new         $BASH\_SUBSHELL variable.
echo; echo

outer\_variable=Outer
global\_variable=
#  Define global variable for "storage" of
#+ value of subshell variable.

(
echo "We are inside the subshell."
echo "Subshell level INSIDE subshell = $BASH\_SUBSHELL"
inner\_variable=Inner

echo "From inside subshell, \\"inner\_variable\\" = $inner\_variable"
echo "From inside subshell, \\"outer\\" = $outer\_variable"

global\_variable="$inner\_variable"   #  Will this allow "exporting"
                                    #+ a subshell variable?
)

echo; echo
echo "We are outside the subshell."
echo "Subshell level OUTSIDE subshell = $BASH\_SUBSHELL"
echo

if \[ -z "$inner\_variable" \]
then
  echo "inner\_variable undefined in main body of shell"
else
  echo "inner\_variable defined in main body of shell"
fi

echo "From main body of shell, \\"inner\_variable\\" = $inner\_variable"
#  $inner\_variable will show as blank (uninitialized)
#+ because variables defined in a subshell are "local variables".
#  Is there a remedy for this?
echo "global\_variable = "$global\_variable""  # Why doesn't this work?

echo

# =======================================================================

# Additionally ...

echo "-----------------"; echo

var=41                                                 # Global variable.

( let "var+=1"; echo "\\$var INSIDE subshell = $var" )  # 42

echo "\\$var OUTSIDE subshell = $var"                   # 41
#  Variable operations inside a subshell, even to a GLOBAL variable
#+ do not affect the value of the variable outside the subshell!


exit 0

#  Question:
#  --------
#  Once having exited a subshell,
#+ is there any way to reenter that very same subshell
#+ to modify or access the subshell variables?

See also [$BASHPID](#BASHPIDREF) and [Example 34-2](#SUBPIT).

**Definition:** The _scope_ of a variable is the context in which it has meaning, in which it has a _value_ that can be referenced. For example, the scope of a [local variable](#LOCALREF1) lies only within the function, block of code, or subshell within which it is defined, while the scope of a _global_ variable is the entire script in which it appears.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

While the [$BASH\_SUBSHELL](#BASHSUBSHELLREF) internal variable indicates the nesting level of a subshell, the [$SHLVL](#SHLVLREF) variable _shows no change_ within a subshell.

echo " \\$BASH\_SUBSHELL outside subshell       = $BASH\_SUBSHELL"           # 0
  ( echo " \\$BASH\_SUBSHELL inside subshell        = $BASH\_SUBSHELL" )     # 1
  ( ( echo " \\$BASH\_SUBSHELL inside nested subshell = $BASH\_SUBSHELL" ) ) # 2
# ^ ^                           \*\*\* nested \*\*\*                        ^ ^

echo

echo " \\$SHLVL outside subshell = $SHLVL"       # 3
( echo " \\$SHLVL inside subshell  = $SHLVL" )   # 3 (No change!)

Directory changes made in a subshell do not carry over to the parent shell.

**Example 21-2. List User Profiles**

#!/bin/bash
# allprofs.sh: Print all user profiles.

# This script written by Heiner Steven, and modified by the document author.

FILE=.bashrc  #  File containing user profile,
              #+ was ".profile" in original script.

for home in \`awk -F: '{print $6}' /etc/passwd\`
do
  \[ -d "$home" \] || continue    # If no home directory, go to next.
  \[ -r "$home" \] || continue    # If not readable, go to next.
  (cd $home; \[ -e $FILE \] && less $FILE)
done

#  When script terminates, there is no need to 'cd' back to original directory,
#+ because 'cd $home' takes place in a subshell.

exit 0

A subshell may be used to set up a "dedicated environment" for a command group.

COMMAND1
COMMAND2
COMMAND3
(
  IFS=:
  PATH=/bin
  unset TERMINFO
  set -C
  shift 5
  COMMAND4
  COMMAND5
  exit 3 # Only exits the subshell!
)
# The parent shell has not been affected, and the environment is preserved.
COMMAND6
COMMAND7

As seen here, the [exit](#EXITREF) command only terminates the subshell in which it is running, _not_ the parent shell or script.

One application of such a "dedicated environment" is testing whether a variable is defined.

if (set -u; : $variable) 2> /dev/null
then
  echo "Variable is set."
fi     #  Variable has been set in current script,
       #+ or is an an internal Bash variable,
       #+ or is present in environment (has been exported).

# Could also be written \[\[ ${variable-x} != x || ${variable-y} != y \]\]
# or                    \[\[ ${variable-x} != x$variable \]\]
# or                    \[\[ ${variable+x} = x \]\]
# or                    \[\[ ${variable-x} != x \]\]

Another application is checking for a lock file:

if (set -C; : > lock\_file) 2> /dev/null
then
  :   # lock\_file didn't exist: no user running the script
else
  echo "Another user is already running that script."
exit 65

Processes may execute in parallel within different subshells. This permits breaking a complex task into subcomponents processed concurrently.

**Example 21-3. Running parallel processes in subshells**

	(cat list1 list2 list3 | sort | uniq > list123) &
	(cat list4 list5 list6 | sort | uniq > list456) &
	# Merges and sorts both sets of lists simultaneously.
	# Running in background ensures parallel execution.
	#
	# Same effect as
	#   cat list1 list2 list3 | sort | uniq > list123 &
	#   cat list4 list5 list6 | sort | uniq > list456 &
	
	wait   # Don't execute the next command until subshells finish.
	
	diff list123 list456

Redirecting I/O to a subshell uses the "|" pipe operator, as in **ls -al | (command)**.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

A code block between [curly brackets](#CODEBLOCKREF) does _not_ launch a subshell.

{ command1; command2; command3; . . . commandN; }

var1=23
echo "$var1"   # 23

{ var1=76; }
echo "$var1"   # 76

Chapter 22. Restricted Shells
=============================

**Disabled commands in restricted shells**

**.** Running a script or portion of a script in _restricted mode_ disables certain commands that would otherwise be available. This is a security measure intended to limit the privileges of the script user and to minimize possible damage from running the script.

The following commands and actions are disabled:

*   Using _cd_ to change the working directory.
    
*   Changing the values of the _$PATH_, _$SHELL_, _$BASH\_ENV_, or _$ENV_ [environmental variables](#ENVREF).
    
*   Reading or changing the _$SHELLOPTS_, shell environmental options.
    
*   Output redirection.
    
*   Invoking commands containing one or more /'s.
    
*   Invoking [exec](#EXECREF) to substitute a different process for the shell.
    
*   Various other commands that would enable monkeying with or attempting to subvert the script for an unintended purpose.
    
*   Getting out of restricted mode within the script.
    

**Example 22-1. Running a script in restricted mode**

#!/bin/bash

#  Starting the script with "#!/bin/bash -r"
#+ runs entire script in restricted mode.

echo

echo "Changing directory."
cd /usr/local
echo "Now in \`pwd\`"
echo "Coming back home."
cd
echo "Now in \`pwd\`"
echo

# Everything up to here in normal, unrestricted mode.

set -r
# set --restricted    has same effect.
echo "==> Now in restricted mode. <=="

echo
echo

echo "Attempting directory change in restricted mode."
cd ..
echo "Still in \`pwd\`"

echo
echo

echo "\\$SHELL = $SHELL"
echo "Attempting to change shell in restricted mode."
SHELL="/bin/ash"
echo
echo "\\$SHELL= $SHELL"

echo
echo

echo "Attempting to redirect output in restricted mode."
ls -l /usr/bin > bin.files
ls -l bin.files    # Try to list attempted file creation effort.

echo

exit 0

Chapter 23. Process Substitution
================================

[Piping](#PIPEREF) the stdout of a command into the stdin of another is a powerful technique. But, what if you need to pipe the stdout of _multiple_ commands? This is where _process substitution_ comes in.

_Process substitution_ feeds the output of a [process](#PROCESSREF) (or processes) into the stdin of another process.

**Template**

Command list enclosed within parentheses

**\>(command\_list)**

**<(command\_list)**

Process substitution uses /dev/fd/<n> files to send the results of the process(es) within parentheses to another process. [\[108\]](#FTN.AEN18244)

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

There is _no_ space between the the "<" or ">" and the parentheses. Space there would give an error message.

bash$ **echo >(true)**
/dev/fd/63

bash$ **echo <(true)**
/dev/fd/63

bash$ **echo >(true) <(true)**
/dev/fd/63 /dev/fd/62

bash$ **wc <(cat /usr/share/dict/linux.words)**
 483523  483523 4992010 /dev/fd/63

bash$ **grep script /usr/share/dict/linux.words | wc**
    262     262    3601

bash$ **wc <(grep script /usr/share/dict/linux.words)**
    262     262    3601 /dev/fd/63
	      

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Bash creates a pipe with two [file descriptors](#FDREF), \--fIn and fOut--. The stdin of [true](#TRUEREF) connects to fOut (dup2(fOut, 0)), then Bash passes a /dev/fd/fIn argument to **echo**. On systems lacking /dev/fd/<n> files, Bash may use temporary files. (Thanks, S.C.)

Process substitution can compare the output of two different commands, or even the output of different options to the same command.

bash$ **comm <(ls -l) <(ls -al)**
total 12
-rw-rw-r--    1 bozo bozo       78 Mar 10 12:58 File0
-rw-rw-r--    1 bozo bozo       42 Mar 10 12:58 File2
-rw-rw-r--    1 bozo bozo      103 Mar 10 12:58 t2.sh
        total 20
        drwxrwxrwx    2 bozo bozo     4096 Mar 10 18:10 .
        drwx------   72 bozo bozo     4096 Mar 10 17:58 ..
        -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo bozo       78 Mar 10 12:58 File0
        -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo bozo       42 Mar 10 12:58 File2
        -rw-rw-r--    1 bozo bozo      103 Mar 10 12:58 t2.sh

Process substitution can compare the contents of two directories -- to see which filenames are in one, but not the other.

diff <(ls $first\_directory) <(ls $second\_directory)

Some other usages and uses of process substitution:

read -a list < <( od -Ad -w24 -t u2 /dev/urandom )
#  Read a list of random numbers from /dev/urandom,
#+ process with "od"
#+ and feed into stdin of "read" . . .

#  From "insertion-sort.bash" example script.
#  Courtesy of JuanJo Ciarlante.

PORT=6881   # bittorrent

# Scan the port to make sure nothing nefarious is going on.
netcat -l $PORT | tee>(md5sum ->mydata-orig.md5) |
gzip | tee>(md5sum - | sed 's/-$/mydata.lz2/'>mydata-gz.md5)>mydata.gz

# Check the decompression:
  gzip -d<mydata.gz | md5sum -c mydata-orig.md5)
# The MD5sum of the original checks stdin and detects compression issues.

#  Bill Davidsen contributed this example
#+ (with light edits by the ABS Guide author).

cat <(ls -l)
# Same as     ls -l | cat

sort -k 9 <(ls -l /bin) <(ls -l /usr/bin) <(ls -l /usr/X11R6/bin)
# Lists all the files in the 3 main 'bin' directories, and sorts by filename.
# Note that three (count 'em) distinct commands are fed to 'sort'.

 
diff <(command1) <(command2)    # Gives difference in command output.

tar cf >(bzip2 -c > file.tar.bz2) $directory\_name
# Calls "tar cf /dev/fd/?? $directory\_name", and "bzip2 -c > file.tar.bz2".
#
# Because of the /dev/fd/<n> system feature,
# the pipe between both commands does not need to be named.
#
# This can be emulated.
#
bzip2 -c < pipe > file.tar.bz2&
tar cf pipe $directory\_name
rm pipe
#        or
exec 3>&1
tar cf /dev/fd/4 $directory\_name 4>&1 >&3 3>&- | bzip2 -c > file.tar.bz2 3>&-
exec 3>&-


# Thanks, StÃ©phane Chazelas

Here is a method of circumventing the problem of an [_echo_ piped to a _while-read loop_](#BADREAD0) running in a subshell.

**Example 23-1. Code block redirection without forking**

#!/bin/bash
# wr-ps.bash: while-read loop with process substitution.

# This example contributed by Tomas Pospisek.
# (Heavily edited by the ABS Guide author.)

echo

echo "random input" | while read i
do
  global=3D": Not available outside the loop."
  # ... because it runs in a subshell.
done

echo "\\$global (from outside the subprocess) = $global"
# $global (from outside the subprocess) =

echo; echo "--"; echo

while read i
do
  echo $i
  global=3D": Available outside the loop."
  # ... because it does NOT run in a subshell.
done < <( echo "random input" )
#    ^ ^

echo "\\$global (using process substitution) = $global"
# Random input
# $global (using process substitution) = 3D: Available outside the loop.


echo; echo "##########"; echo



# And likewise . . .

declare -a inloop
index=0
cat $0 | while read line
do
  inloop\[$index\]="$line"
  ((index++))
  # It runs in a subshell, so ...
done
echo "OUTPUT = "
echo ${inloop\[\*\]}           # ... nothing echoes.


echo; echo "--"; echo


declare -a outloop
index=0
while read line
do
  outloop\[$index\]="$line"
  ((index++))
  # It does NOT run in a subshell, so ...
done < <( cat $0 )
echo "OUTPUT = "
echo ${outloop\[\*\]}          # ... the entire script echoes.

exit $?

This is a similar example.

**Example 23-2. Redirecting the output of _process substitution_ into a loop.**

#!/bin/bash
# psub.bash

# As inspired by Diego Molina (thanks!).

declare -a array0
while read
do
  array0\[${#array0\[@\]}\]="$REPLY"
done < <( sed -e 's/bash/CRASH-BANG!/' $0 | grep bin | awk '{print $1}' )
#  Sets the default 'read' variable, $REPLY, by process substitution,
#+ then copies it into an array.

echo "${array0\[@\]}"

exit $?

# ====================================== #

bash psub.bash

#!/bin/CRASH-BANG! done #!/bin/CRASH-BANG!

A reader sent in the following interesting example of process substitution.

\# Script fragment taken from SuSE distribution:

# --------------------------------------------------------------#
while read  des what mask iface; do
# Some commands ...
done < <(route -n)  
#    ^ ^  First < is redirection, second is process substitution.

# To test it, let's make it do something.
while read  des what mask iface; do
  echo $des $what $mask $iface
done < <(route -n)  

# Output:
# Kernel IP routing table
# Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
# 127.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 U 0 0 0 lo
# --------------------------------------------------------------#

#  As StÃ©phane Chazelas points out,
#+ an easier-to-understand equivalent is:
route -n |
  while read des what mask iface; do   # Variables set from output of pipe.
    echo $des $what $mask $iface
  done  #  This yields the same output as above.
        #  However, as Ulrich Gayer points out . . .
        #+ this simplified equivalent uses a subshell for the while loop,
        #+ and therefore the variables disappear when the pipe terminates.
	
# --------------------------------------------------------------#
	
#  However, Filip Moritz comments that there is a subtle difference
#+ between the above two examples, as the following shows.

(
route -n | while read x; do ((y++)); done
echo $y # $y is still unset

while read x; do ((y++)); done < <(route -n)
echo $y # $y has the number of lines of output of route -n
)

More generally spoken
(
: | x=x
# seems to start a subshell like
: | ( x=x )
# while
x=x < <(:)
# does not
)

# This is useful, when parsing csv and the like.
# That is, in effect, what the original SuSE code fragment does.

Chapter 24. Functions
=====================

Like "real" programming languages, Bash has functions, though in a somewhat limited implementation. A function is a subroutine, a [code block](#CODEBLOCKREF) that implements a set of operations, a "black box" that performs a specified task. Wherever there is repetitive code, when a task repeats with only slight variations in procedure, then consider using a function.

**function** _function\_name_ {  
_command_...  
}  

or

_function\_name_ () {  
_command_...  
}  

This second form will cheer the hearts of C programmers (and is more [portable](#PORTABILITYISSUES)).

As in C, the function's opening bracket may optionally appear on the second line.

_function\_name_ ()  
{  
_command_...  
}  

![Note](../images/note.gif)

A function may be "compacted" into a single line.

fun () { echo "This is a function"; echo; }
#                                 ^     ^

In this case, however, a _semicolon_ must follow the final command in the function.

fun () { echo "This is a function"; echo } # Error!
#                                       ^

fun2 () { echo "Even a single-command function? Yes!"; }
#                                                    ^

Functions are called, _triggered_, simply by invoking their names. _A function call is equivalent to a command._

**Example 24-1. Simple functions**

#!/bin/bash
# ex59.sh: Exercising functions (simple).

JUST\_A\_SECOND=1

funky ()
{ # This is about as simple as functions get.
  echo "This is a funky function."
  echo "Now exiting funky function."
} # Function declaration must precede call.


fun ()
{ # A somewhat more complex function.
  i=0
  REPEATS=30

  echo
  echo "And now the fun really begins."
  echo

  sleep $JUST\_A\_SECOND    # Hey, wait a second!
  while \[ $i -lt $REPEATS \]
  do
    echo "----------FUNCTIONS---------->"
    echo "<------------ARE-------------"
    echo "<------------FUN------------>"
    echo
    let "i+=1"
  done
}

  # Now, call the functions.

funky
fun

exit $?

The function definition must precede the first call to it. There is no method of "declaring" the function, as, for example, in C.

f1
# Will give an error message, since function "f1" not yet defined.

declare -f f1      # This doesn't help either.
f1                 # Still an error message.

# However...

	  
f1 ()
{
  echo "Calling function \\"f2\\" from within function \\"f1\\"."
  f2
}

f2 ()
{
  echo "Function \\"f2\\"."
}

f1  #  Function "f2" is not actually called until this point,
    #+ although it is referenced before its definition.
    #  This is permissible.
    
    # Thanks, S.C.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Functions may not be empty!

#!/bin/bash
# empty-function.sh

empty ()
{
}

exit 0  # Will not exit here!

# $ sh empty-function.sh
# empty-function.sh: line 6: syntax error near unexpected token \`}'
# empty-function.sh: line 6: \`}'

# $ echo $?
# 2


# Note that a function containing only comments is empty.

func ()
{
  # Comment 1.
  # Comment 2.
  # This is still an empty function.
  # Thank you, Mark Bova, for pointing this out.
}
# Results in same error message as above.


# However ...

not\_quite\_empty ()
{
  illegal\_command
} #  A script containing this function will \*not\* bomb
  #+ as long as the function is not called.

not\_empty ()
{
  :
} # Contains a : (null command), and this is okay.


# Thank you, Dominick Geyer and Thiemo Kellner.

It is even possible to nest a function within another function, although this is not very useful.

f1 ()
{

  f2 () # nested
  {
    echo "Function \\"f2\\", inside \\"f1\\"."
  }

}  

f2  #  Gives an error message.
    #  Even a preceding "declare -f f2" wouldn't help.

echo    

f1  #  Does nothing, since calling "f1" does not automatically call "f2".
f2  #  Now, it's all right to call "f2",
    #+ since its definition has been made visible by calling "f1".

    # Thanks, S.C.

Function declarations can appear in unlikely places, even where a command would otherwise go.

ls -l | foo() { echo "foo"; }  # Permissible, but useless.



if \[ "$USER" = bozo \]
then
  bozo\_greet ()   # Function definition embedded in an if/then construct.
  {
    echo "Hello, Bozo."
  }
fi  

bozo\_greet        # Works only for Bozo, and other users get an error.



# Something like this might be useful in some contexts.
NO\_EXIT=1   # Will enable function definition below.

\[\[ $NO\_EXIT -eq 1 \]\] && exit() { true; }     # Function definition in an "and-list".
# If $NO\_EXIT is 1, declares "exit ()".
# This disables the "exit" builtin by aliasing it to "true".

exit  # Invokes "exit ()" function, not "exit" builtin.



# Or, similarly:
filename=file1

\[ -f "$filename" \] &&
foo () { rm -f "$filename"; echo "File "$filename" deleted."; } ||
foo () { echo "File "$filename" not found."; touch bar; }

foo

# Thanks, S.C. and Christopher Head

Function names can take strange forms.

  \_(){ for i in {1..10}; do echo -n "$FUNCNAME"; done; echo; }
# ^^^         No space between function name and parentheses.
#             This doesn't always work. Why not?

# Now, let's invoke the function.
  \_         # \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
#             ^^^^^^^^^^   10 underscores (10 x function name)!  
# A "naked" underscore is an acceptable function name.


# In fact, a colon is likewise an acceptable function name.

:(){ echo ":"; }; :

# Of what use is this?
# It's a devious way to obfuscate the code in a script.

See also [Example A-56](#GRONSFELD)

![Note](../images/note.gif)

What happens when different versions of the same function appear in a script?

\#  As Yan Chen points out,
#  when a function is defined multiple times,
#  the final version is what is invoked.
#  This is not, however, particularly useful.

func ()
{
  echo "First version of func ()."
}

func ()
{
  echo "Second version of func ()."
}

func   # Second version of func ().

exit $?

#  It is even possible to use functions to override
#+ or preempt system commands.
#  Of course, this is \*not\* advisable.

* * *

24.1. Complex Functions and Function Complexities
=================================================

Functions may process arguments passed to them and return an [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) to the script for further processing.

function\_name $arg1 $arg2

The function refers to the passed arguments by position (as if they were [positional parameters](#POSPARAMREF)), that is, $1, $2, and so forth.

**Example 24-2. Function Taking Parameters**

#!/bin/bash
# Functions and parameters

DEFAULT=default                             # Default param value.

func2 () {
   if \[ -z "$1" \]                           # Is parameter #1 zero length?
   then
     echo "-Parameter #1 is zero length.-"  # Or no parameter passed.
   else
     echo "-Parameter #1 is \\"$1\\".-"
   fi

   variable=${1-$DEFAULT}                   #  What does
   echo "variable = $variable"              #+ parameter substitution show?
                                            #  ---------------------------
                                            #  It distinguishes between
                                            #+ no param and a null param.

   if \[ "$2" \]
   then
     echo "-Parameter #2 is \\"$2\\".-"
   fi

   return 0
}

echo
   
echo "Nothing passed."   
func2                          # Called with no params
echo


echo "Zero-length parameter passed."
func2 ""                       # Called with zero-length param
echo

echo "Null parameter passed."
func2 "$uninitialized\_param"   # Called with uninitialized param
echo

echo "One parameter passed."   
func2 first           # Called with one param
echo

echo "Two parameters passed."   
func2 first second    # Called with two params
echo

echo "\\"\\" \\"second\\" passed."
func2 "" second       # Called with zero-length first parameter
echo                  # and ASCII string as a second one.

exit 0

![Important](../images/important.gif)

The [shift](#SHIFTREF) command works on arguments passed to functions (see [Example 36-18](#MULTIPLICATION)).

But, what about command-line arguments passed to the script? Does a function see them? Well, let's clear up the confusion.

**Example 24-3. Functions and command-line args passed to the script**

#!/bin/bash
# func-cmdlinearg.sh
#  Call this script with a command-line argument,
#+ something like $0 arg1.


func ()

{
echo "$1"   # Echoes first arg passed to the function.
}           # Does a command-line arg qualify?

echo "First call to function: no arg passed."
echo "See if command-line arg is seen."
func
# No! Command-line arg not seen.

echo "============================================================"
echo
echo "Second call to function: command-line arg passed explicitly."
func $1
# Now it's seen!

exit 0

In contrast to certain other programming languages, shell scripts normally pass only value parameters to functions. Variable names (which are actually _pointers_), if passed as parameters to functions, will be treated as string literals. _Functions interpret their arguments literally._

[Indirect variable references](#IVRREF) (see [Example 37-2](#EX78)) provide a clumsy sort of mechanism for passing variable pointers to functions.

**Example 24-4. Passing an indirect reference to a function**

#!/bin/bash
# ind-func.sh: Passing an indirect reference to a function.

echo\_var ()
{
echo "$1"
}

message=Hello
Hello=Goodbye

echo\_var "$message"        # Hello
# Now, let's pass an indirect reference to the function.
echo\_var "${!message}"     # Goodbye

echo "-------------"

# What happens if we change the contents of "hello" variable?
Hello="Hello, again!"
echo\_var "$message"        # Hello
echo\_var "${!message}"     # Hello, again!

exit 0

The next logical question is whether parameters can be dereferenced _after_ being passed to a function.

**Example 24-5. Dereferencing a parameter passed to a function**

#!/bin/bash
# dereference.sh
# Dereferencing parameter passed to a function.
# Script by Bruce W. Clare.

dereference ()
{
     y=\\$"$1"   # Name of variable (not value!).
     echo $y    # $Junk

     x=\`eval "expr \\"$y\\" "\`
     echo $1=$x
     eval "$1=\\"Some Different Text \\""  # Assign new value.
}

Junk="Some Text"
echo $Junk "before"    # Some Text before

dereference Junk
echo $Junk "after"     # Some Different Text after

exit 0

**Example 24-6. Again, dereferencing a parameter passed to a function**

#!/bin/bash
# ref-params.sh: Dereferencing a parameter passed to a function.
#                (Complex Example)

ITERATIONS=3  # How many times to get input.
icount=1

my\_read () {
  #  Called with my\_read varname,
  #+ outputs the previous value between brackets as the default value,
  #+ then asks for a new value.

  local local\_var

  echo -n "Enter a value "
  eval 'echo -n "\[$'$1'\] "'  #  Previous value.
# eval echo -n "\[\\$$1\] "     #  Easier to understand,
                             #+ but loses trailing space in user prompt.
  read local\_var
  \[ -n "$local\_var" \] && eval $1=\\$local\_var

  # "And-list": if "local\_var" then set "$1" to its value.
}

echo

while \[ "$icount" -le "$ITERATIONS" \]
do
  my\_read var
  echo "Entry #$icount = $var"
  let "icount += 1"

**Exit and Return**

**exit status**

Functions return a value, called an _exit status_. This is analogous to the [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) returned by a command. The exit status may be explicitly specified by a **return** statement, otherwise it is the exit status of the last command in the function (0 if successful, and a non-zero error code if not). This [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) may be used in the script by referencing it as [$?](#XSTATVARREF). This mechanism effectively permits script functions to have a "return value" similar to C functions.

**return**

Terminates a function. A **return** command [\[109\]](#FTN.AEN18474) optionally takes an _integer_ argument, which is returned to the calling script as the "exit status" of the function, and this exit status is assigned to the variable [$?](#XSTATVARREF).

**Example 24-7. Maximum of two numbers**

#!/bin/bash
# max.sh: Maximum of two integers.

E\_PARAM\_ERR=250    # If less than 2 params passed to function.
EQUAL=251          # Return value if both params equal.
#  Error values out of range of any
#+ params that might be fed to the function.

max2 ()             # Returns larger of two numbers.
{                   # Note: numbers compared must be less than 250.
if \[ -z "$2" \]
then
  return $E\_PARAM\_ERR
fi

if \[ "$1" -eq "$2" \]
then
  return $EQUAL
else
  if \[ "$1" -gt "$2" \]
  then
    return $1
  else
    return $2
  fi
fi
}

max2 33 34
return\_val=$?

if \[ "$return\_val" -eq $E\_PARAM\_ERR \]
then
  echo "Need to pass two parameters to the function."
elif \[ "$return\_val" -eq $EQUAL \]
  then
    echo "The two numbers are equal."
else
    echo "The larger of the two numbers is $return\_val."
fi  

  
exit 0

#  Exercise (easy):
#  ---------------
#  Convert this to an interactive script,
#+ that is, have the script ask for input (two numbers).

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

For a function to return a string or array, use a dedicated variable.

count\_lines\_in\_etc\_passwd()
{
  \[\[ -r /etc/passwd \]\] && REPLY=$(echo $(wc -l < /etc/passwd))
  #  If /etc/passwd is readable, set REPLY to line count.
  #  Returns both a parameter value and status information.
  #  The 'echo' seems unnecessary, but . . .
  #+ it removes excess whitespace from the output.
}

if count\_lines\_in\_etc\_passwd
then
  echo "There are $REPLY lines in /etc/passwd."
else
  echo "Cannot count lines in /etc/passwd."
fi

![Important](../images/important.gif)

The largest positive integer a function can return is 255. The **return** command is closely tied to the concept of [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF), which accounts for this particular limitation. Fortunately, there are various [workarounds](#RVT) for those situations requiring a large integer return value from a function.

**Example 24-9. Testing large return values in a function**

#!/bin/bash
# return-test.sh

# The largest positive value a function can return is 255.

return\_test ()         # Returns whatever passed to it.
{
  return $1
}

return\_test 27         # o.k.
echo $?                # Returns 27.
  
return\_test 255        # Still o.k.
echo $?                # Returns 255.

return\_test 257        # Error!
echo $?                # Returns 1 (return code for miscellaneous error).

# =========================================================
return\_test -151896    # Do large negative numbers work?
echo $?                # Will this return -151896?
                       # No! It returns 168.
#  Version of Bash before 2.05b permitted
#+ large negative integer return values.
#  It happened to be a useful feature.
#  Newer versions of Bash unfortunately plug this loophole.
#  This may break older scripts.
#  Caution!
# =========================================================

exit 0

A workaround for obtaining large integer "return values" is to simply assign the "return value" to a global variable.

Return\_Val=   # Global variable to hold oversize return value of function.

alt\_return\_test ()
{
  fvar=$1
  Return\_Val=$fvar
  return   # Returns 0 (success).
}

alt\_return\_test 1
echo $?                              # 0
echo "return value = $Return\_Val"    # 1

alt\_return\_test 256
echo "return value = $Return\_Val"    # 256

alt\_return\_test 257
echo "return value = $Return\_Val"    # 257

alt\_return\_test 25701
echo "return value = $Return\_Val"    #25701

A more elegant method is to have the function **echo** its "return value to stdout," and then capture it by [command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF). See the [discussion of this](#RVT) in [Section 36.7](#ASSORTEDTIPS).

**Example 24-10. Comparing two large integers**

#!/bin/bash
# max2.sh: Maximum of two LARGE integers.

#  This is the previous "max.sh" example,
#+ modified to permit comparing large integers.

EQUAL=0             # Return value if both params equal.
E\_PARAM\_ERR=-99999  # Not enough params passed to function.
#           ^^^^^^    Out of range of any params that might be passed.

max2 ()             # "Returns" larger of two numbers.
{
if \[ -z "$2" \]
then
  echo $E\_PARAM\_ERR
  return
fi

if \[ "$1" -eq "$2" \]
then
  echo $EQUAL
  return
else
  if \[ "$1" -gt "$2" \]
  then
    retval=$1
  else
    retval=$2
  fi
fi

echo $retval        # Echoes (to stdout), rather than returning value.
                    # Why?
}


return\_val=$(max2 33001 33997)
#            ^^^^             Function name
#                 ^^^^^ ^^^^^ Params passed
#  This is actually a form of command substitution:
#+ treating a function as if it were a command,
#+ and assigning the stdout of the function to the variable "return\_val."


# ========================= OUTPUT ========================
if \[ "$return\_val" -eq "$E\_PARAM\_ERR" \]
  then
  echo "Error in parameters passed to comparison function!"
elif \[ "$return\_val" -eq "$EQUAL" \]
  then
    echo "The two numbers are equal."
else
    echo "The larger of the two numbers is $return\_val."
fi
# =========================================================
  
exit 0

#  Exercises:
#  ---------
#  1) Find a more elegant way of testing
#+    the parameters passed to the function.
#  2) Simplify the if/then structure at "OUTPUT."
#  3) Rewrite the script to take input from command-line parameters.

Here is another example of capturing a function "return value." Understanding it requires some knowledge of [awk](#AWKREF).

month\_length ()  # Takes month number as an argument.
{                # Returns number of days in month.
monthD="31 28 31 30 31 30 31 31 30 31 30 31"  # Declare as local?
echo "$monthD" | awk '{ print $'"${1}"' }'    # Tricky.
#                             ^^^^^^^^^
# Parameter passed to function  ($1 -- month number), then to awk.
# Awk sees this as "print $1 . . . print $12" (depending on month number)
# Template for passing a parameter to embedded awk script:
#                                 $'"${script\_parameter}"'

#    Here's a slightly simpler awk construct:
#    echo $monthD | awk -v month=$1 '{print $(month)}'
#    Uses the -v awk option, which assigns a variable value
#+   prior to execution of the awk program block.
#    Thank you, Rich.

#  Needs error checking for correct parameter range (1-12)
#+ and for February in leap year.
}

# ----------------------------------------------
# Usage example:
month=4        # April, for example (4th month).
days\_in=$(month\_length $month)
echo $days\_in  # 30
# ----------------------------------------------

See also [Example A-7](#DAYSBETWEEN) and [Example A-37](#STDDEV).

**Exercise:** Using what we have just learned, extend the previous [Roman numerals example](#EX61) to accept arbitrarily large input.

**Redirection**

_Redirecting the stdin of a function_

A function is essentially a [code block](#CODEBLOCKREF), which means its stdin can be redirected (as in [Example 3-1](#EX8)).

**Example 24-11. Real name from username**

#!/bin/bash
# realname.sh
#
# From username, gets "real name" from /etc/passwd.


ARGCOUNT=1       # Expect one arg.
E\_WRONGARGS=85

file=/etc/passwd
pattern=$1

if \[ $# -ne "$ARGCOUNT" \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` USERNAME"
  exit $E\_WRONGARGS
fi  

file\_excerpt ()    #  Scan file for pattern,
{                  #+ then print relevant portion of line.
  while read line  # "while" does not necessarily need \[ condition \]
  do
    echo "$line" | grep $1 | awk -F":" '{ print $5 }'
    # Have awk use ":" delimiter.
  done
} <$file  # Redirect into function's stdin.

file\_excerpt $pattern

# Yes, this entire script could be reduced to
#       grep PATTERN /etc/passwd | awk -F":" '{ print $5 }'
# or
#       awk -F: '/PATTERN/ {print $5}'
# or
#       awk -F: '($1 == "username") { print $5 }' # real name from username
# However, it might not be as instructive.

exit 0

There is an alternate, and perhaps less confusing method of redirecting a function's stdin. This involves redirecting the stdin to an embedded bracketed code block within the function.

\# Instead of:
Function ()
{
 ...
 } < file

# Try this:
Function ()
{
  {
    ...
   } < file
}

# Similarly,

Function ()  # This works.
{
  {
   echo $\*
  } | tr a b
}

Function ()  # This doesn't work.
{
  echo $\*
} | tr a b   # A nested code block is mandatory here.

24.2. Local Variables
=====================

**What makes a variable _local_?**

local variables

A variable declared as _local_ is one that is visible only within the [block of code](#CODEBLOCKREF) in which it appears. It has local [scope](#SCOPEREF). In a function, a _local variable_ has meaning only within that function block. [\[110\]](#FTN.AEN18568)

**Example 24-12. Local variable visibility**

#!/bin/bash
# ex62.sh: Global and local variables inside a function.

func ()
{
  local loc\_var=23       # Declared as local variable.
  echo                   # Uses the 'local' builtin.
  echo "\\"loc\_var\\" in function = $loc\_var"
  global\_var=999         # Not declared as local.
                         # Therefore, defaults to global. 
  echo "\\"global\_var\\" in function = $global\_var"
}  

func

# Now, to see if local variable "loc\_var" exists outside the function.

echo
echo "\\"loc\_var\\" outside function = $loc\_var"
                                      # $loc\_var outside function = 
                                      # No, $loc\_var not visible globally.
echo "\\"global\_var\\" outside function = $global\_var"
                                      # $global\_var outside function = 999
                                      # $global\_var is visible globally.
echo				      

exit 0
#  In contrast to C, a Bash variable declared inside a function
#+ is local ONLY if declared as such.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Before a function is called, _all_ variables declared within the function are invisible outside the body of the function, not just those explicitly declared as _local_.

#!/bin/bash

func ()
{
global\_var=37    #  Visible only within the function block
                 #+ before the function has been called. 
}                #  END OF FUNCTION

echo "global\_var = $global\_var"  # global\_var =
                                 #  Function "func" has not yet been called,
                                 #+ so $global\_var is not visible here.

func
echo "global\_var = $global\_var"  # global\_var = 37
                                 # Has been set by function call.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

As Evgeniy Ivanov points out, when declaring and setting a local variable in a single command, apparently the order of operations is to _first set the variable, and only afterwards restrict it to local scope_. This is reflected in the [return value](#EXITSTATUSREF).

#!/bin/bash

echo "==OUTSIDE Function (global)=="
t=$(exit 1)
echo $?      # 1
             # As expected.
echo

function0 ()
{

echo "==INSIDE Function=="
echo "Global"
t0=$(exit 1)
echo $?      # 1
             # As expected.

echo
echo "Local declared & assigned in same command."
local t1=$(exit 1)
echo $?      # 0
             # Unexpected!
#  Apparently, the variable assignment takes place before
#+ the local declaration.
#+ The return value is for the latter.

echo
echo "Local declared, then assigned (separate commands)."
local t2
t2=$(exit 1)
echo $?      # 1
             # As expected.

}

function0

24.2.1. Local variables and recursion.
--------------------------------------

_Recursion_ is an interesting and sometimes useful form of _self-reference_. [Herbert Mayer](#MAYERREF) defines it as ". . . expressing an algorithm by using a simpler version of that same algorithm . . ."

Consider a definition defined in terms of itself, [\[111\]](#FTN.AEN18607) an expression implicit in its own expression, [\[112\]](#FTN.AEN18610) _a snake swallowing its own tail_, [\[113\]](#FTN.AEN18614) or . . . a function that calls itself. [\[114\]](#FTN.AEN18617)

**Example 24-13. Demonstration of a simple recursive function**

#!/bin/bash
# recursion-demo.sh
# Demonstration of recursion.

RECURSIONS=9   # How many times to recurse.
r\_count=0      # Must be global. Why?

recurse ()
{
  var="$1"

  while \[ "$var" -ge 0 \]
  do
    echo "Recursion count = "$r\_count"  +-+  \\$var = "$var""
    (( var-- )); (( r\_count++ ))
    recurse "$var"  #  Function calls itself (recurses)
  done              #+ until what condition is met?
}

recurse $RECURSIONS

exit $?

**Example 24-14. Another simple demonstration**

#!/bin/bash
# recursion-def.sh
# A script that defines "recursion" in a rather graphic way.

RECURSIONS=10
r\_count=0
sp=" "

define\_recursion ()
{
  ((r\_count++))
  sp="$sp"" "
  echo -n "$sp"
  echo "\\"The act of recurring ... \\""   # Per 1913 Webster's dictionary.

  while \[ $r\_count -le $RECURSIONS \]
  do
    define\_recursion
  done
}

echo
echo "Recursion: "
define\_recursion
echo

exit $?

Local variables are a useful tool for writing recursive code, but this practice generally involves a great deal of computational overhead and is definitely _not_ recommended in a shell script. [\[115\]](#FTN.AEN18632)

**Example 24-15. Recursion, using a local variable**

#!/bin/bash

#               factorial
#               ---------


# Does bash permit recursion?
# Well, yes, but...
# It's so slow that you gotta have rocks in your head to try it.


MAX\_ARG=5
E\_WRONG\_ARGS=85
E\_RANGE\_ERR=86


if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` number"
  exit $E\_WRONG\_ARGS
fi

if \[ "$1" -gt $MAX\_ARG \]
then
  echo "Out of range ($MAX\_ARG is maximum)."
  #  Let's get real now.
  #  If you want greater range than this,
  #+ rewrite it in a Real Programming Language.
  exit $E\_RANGE\_ERR
fi  

fact ()
{
  local number=$1
  #  Variable "number" must be declared as local,
  #+ otherwise this doesn't work.
  if \[ "$number" -eq 0 \]
  then
    factorial=1    # Factorial of 0 = 1.
  else
    let "decrnum = number - 1"
    fact $decrnum  # Recursive function call (the function calls itself).
    let "factorial = $number \* $?"
  fi

  return $factorial
}

fact $1
echo "Factorial of $1 is $?."

exit 0

Also see [Example A-15](#PRIMES) for an example of recursion in a script. Be aware that recursion is resource-intensive and executes slowly, and is therefore generally not appropriate in a script.

24.3. Recursion Without Local Variables
=======================================

A function may recursively call itself even without use of local variables.

# ---------------------------------

MAXTERM=15       # Number of terms (+1) to generate.
MINIDX=2         # If idx is less than 2, then Fibo(idx) = idx.

Fibonacci ()
{
  idx=$1   # Doesn't need to be local. Why not?
  if \[ "$idx" -lt "$MINIDX" \]
  then
    echo "$idx"  # First two terms are 0 1 ... see above.
  else
    (( --idx ))  # j-1
    term1=$( Fibonacci $idx )   #  Fibo(j-1)

    (( --idx ))  # j-2
    term2=$( Fibonacci $idx )   #  Fibo(j-2)

    echo $(( term1 + term2 ))
  fi
  #  An ugly, ugly kludge.
  #  The more elegant implementation of recursive fibo in C
  #+ is a straightforward translation of the algorithm in lines 7 - 10.
}

for i in $(seq 0 $MAXTERM)
do  # Calculate $MAXTERM+1 terms.
  FIBO=$(Fibonacci $i)
  echo -n "$FIBO "
done
# 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610
# Takes a while, doesn't it? Recursion in a script is slow.

# The Towers Of Hanoi

#=================================================================#
#  The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle attributed to
#+ Edouard Lucas, a nineteenth-century French mathematician.
#
#  There are three vertical posts set in a base.
#  The first post has a set of annular rings stacked on it.
#  These rings are disks with a hole drilled out of the center,
#+ so they can slip over the posts and rest flat.
#  The rings have different diameters, and they stack in ascending
#+ order, according to size.
#  The smallest ring is on top, and the largest on the bottom.
#
#  The task is to transfer the stack of rings
#+ to one of the other posts.
#  You can move only one ring at a time to another post.
#  You are permitted to move rings back to the original post.
#  You may place a smaller ring atop a larger one,
#+ but \*not\* vice versa.
#  Again, it is forbidden to place a larger ring atop a smaller one.
#
#  For a small number of rings, only a few moves are required.
#+ For each additional ring,
#+ the required number of moves approximately doubles,
#+ and the "strategy" becomes increasingly complicated.

Chapter 25. Aliases
===================

A Bash _alias_ is essentially nothing more than a keyboard shortcut, an abbreviation, a means of avoiding typing a long command sequence. If, for example, we include **alias lm="ls -l | more"** in the [~/.bashrc file](#SAMPLE-BASHRC), then each **lm** [\[116\]](#FTN.AEN18669) typed at the command-line will automatically be replaced by a **ls -l | more**. This can save a great deal of typing at the command-line and avoid having to remember complex combinations of commands and options. Setting **alias rm="rm -i"** (interactive mode delete) may save a good deal of grief, since it can prevent inadvertently deleting important files.

In a script, aliases have very limited usefulness. It would be nice if aliases could assume some of the functionality of the **C** preprocessor, such as macro expansion, but unfortunately Bash does not expand arguments within the alias body. [\[117\]](#FTN.AEN18676) Moreover, a script fails to expand an alias itself within "compound constructs," such as [if/then](#IFTHEN) statements, loops, and functions. An added limitation is that an alias will not expand recursively. Almost invariably, whatever we would like an alias to do could be accomplished much more effectively with a [function](#FUNCTIONREF).

**Example 25-1. Aliases within a script**

#!/bin/bash
# alias.sh

shopt -s expand\_aliases
# Must set this option, else script will not expand aliases.


# First, some fun.
alias Jesse\_James='echo "\\"Alias Jesse James\\" was a 1959 comedy starring Bob Hope."'
Jesse\_James

echo; echo; echo;

alias ll="ls -l"
# May use either single (') or double (") quotes to define an alias.

echo "Trying aliased \\"ll\\":"
ll /usr/X11R6/bin/mk\*   #\* Alias works.

echo

directory=/usr/X11R6/bin/
prefix=mk\*  # See if wild card causes problems.
echo "Variables \\"directory\\" + \\"prefix\\" = $directory$prefix"
echo

alias lll="ls -l $directory$prefix"

echo "Trying aliased \\"lll\\":"
lll         # Long listing of all files in /usr/X11R6/bin stating with mk.
# An alias can handle concatenated variables -- including wild card -- o.k.




TRUE=1

echo

if \[ TRUE \]
then
  alias rr="ls -l"
  echo "Trying aliased \\"rr\\" within if/then statement:"
  rr /usr/X11R6/bin/mk\*   #\* Error message results!
  # Aliases not expanded within compound statements.
  echo "However, previously expanded alias still recognized:"
  ll /usr/X11R6/bin/mk\*
fi  

echo

count=0
while \[ $count -lt 3 \]
do
  alias rrr="ls -l"
  echo "Trying aliased \\"rrr\\" within \\"while\\" loop:"
  rrr /usr/X11R6/bin/mk\*   #\* Alias will not expand here either.
                           #  alias.sh: line 57: rrr: command not found
  let count+=1
done 

echo; echo

alias xyz='cat $0'   # Script lists itself.
                     # Note strong quotes.
xyz
#  This seems to work,
#+ although the Bash documentation suggests that it shouldn't.
#
#  However, as Steve Jacobson points out,
#+ the "$0" parameter expands immediately upon declaration of the alias.

exit 0

The **unalias** command removes a previously set _alias_.

**Example 25-2. _unalias_: Setting and unsetting an alias**

#!/bin/bash
# unalias.sh

shopt -s expand\_aliases  # Enables alias expansion.

alias llm='ls -al | more'
llm

echo

unalias llm              # Unset alias.
llm
# Error message results, since 'llm' no longer recognized.

exit 0

bash$ **./unalias.sh**

Chapter 26. List Constructs
===========================

The _and list_ and _or list_ constructs provide a means of processing a number of commands consecutively. These can effectively replace complex nested [if/then](#TESTCONSTRUCTS1) or even [case](#CASEESAC1) statements.

**Chaining together commands**

and list

command-1 && command-2 && command-3 && ... command-n

Each command executes in turn, provided that the previous command has given a return value of _true_ (zero). At the first _false_ (non-zero) return, the command chain terminates (the first command returning _false_ is the last one to execute).

An interesting use of a two-condition _and list_ from an early version of YongYe's [Tetris game script](http://bash.deta.in/Tetris_Game.sh):

equation()

{  # core algorithm used for doubling and halving the coordinates
   \[\[ ${cdx} \]\] && ((y=cy+(ccy-cdy)${2}2))
   eval ${1}+=\\"${x} ${y} \\"
}

**Example 26-1. Using an _and list_ to test for command-line arguments**

#!/bin/bash
# and list

if \[ ! -z "$1" \] && echo "Argument #1 = $1" && \[ ! -z "$2" \] && \\
#                ^^                         ^^               ^^
echo "Argument #2 = $2"
then
  echo "At least 2 arguments passed to script."
  # All the chained commands return true.
else
  echo "Fewer than 2 arguments passed to script."
  # At least one of the chained commands returns false.
fi  
# Note that "if \[ ! -z $1 \]" works, but its alleged equivalent,
#   "if \[ -n $1 \]" does not.
#     However, quoting fixes this.
#  if "\[ -n "$1" \]" works.
#           ^  ^    Careful!
# It is always best to QUOTE the variables being tested.


# This accomplishes the same thing, using "pure" if/then statements.
if \[ ! -z "$1" \]
then
  echo "Argument #1 = $1"
fi
if \[ ! -z "$2" \]
then
  echo "Argument #2 = $2"
  echo "At least 2 arguments passed to script."
else
  echo "Fewer than 2 arguments passed to script."
fi
# It's longer and more ponderous than using an "and list".


exit $?

**Example 26-2. Another command-line arg test using an _and list_**

#!/bin/bash

ARGS=1        # Number of arguments expected.
E\_BADARGS=85  # Exit value if incorrect number of args passed.

test $# -ne $ARGS && \\
#    ^^^^^^^^^^^^ condition #1
echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` $ARGS argument(s)" && exit $E\_BADARGS
#                                             ^^
#  If condition #1 tests true (wrong number of args passed to script),
#+ then the rest of the line executes, and script terminates.

# Line below executes only if the above test fails.
echo "Correct number of arguments passed to this script."

exit 0

# To check exit value, do a "echo $?" after script termination.

Of course, an _and list_ can also _set_ variables to a default value.

arg1=$@ && \[ -z "$arg1" \] && arg1=DEFAULT
		
              # Set $arg1 to command-line arguments, if any.
              # But . . . set to DEFAULT if not specified on command-line.

or list

command-1 || command-2 || command-3 || ... command-n

Each command executes in turn for as long as the previous command returns false. At the first true return, the command chain terminates (the first command returning true is the last one to execute). This is obviously the inverse of the "and list".

**Example 26-3. Using _or lists_ in combination with an _and list_**

#!/bin/bash

#  delete.sh, a not-so-cunning file deletion utility.
#  Usage: delete filename

E\_BADARGS=85

if \[ -z "$1" \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` filename"
  exit $E\_BADARGS  # No arg? Bail out.
else  
  file=$1          # Set filename.
fi  


\[ ! -f "$file" \] && echo "File \\"$file\\" not found. \\
Cowardly refusing to delete a nonexistent file."
# AND LIST, to give error message if file not present.
# Note echo message continuing on to a second line after an escape.

\[ ! -f "$file" \] || (rm -f $file; echo "File \\"$file\\" deleted.")
# OR LIST, to delete file if present.

# Note logic inversion above.
# AND LIST executes on true, OR LIST on false.

exit $?

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

If the first command in an _or list_ returns true, it _will_ execute.

\# ==> The following snippets from the /etc/rc.d/init.d/single
#+==> script by Miquel van Smoorenburg
#+==> illustrate use of "and" and "or" lists.
# ==> "Arrowed" comments added by document author.

\[ -x /usr/bin/clear \] && /usr/bin/clear
  # ==> If /usr/bin/clear exists, then invoke it.
  # ==> Checking for the existence of a command before calling it
  #+==> avoids error messages and other awkward consequences.

  # ==> . . .

# If they want to run something in single user mode, might as well run it...
for i in /etc/rc1.d/S\[0-9\]\[0-9\]\* ; do
        # Check if the script is there.
        \[ -x "$i" \] || continue
  # ==> If corresponding file in $PWD \*not\* found,
  #+==> then "continue" by jumping to the top of the loop.

        # Reject backup files and files generated by rpm.
        case "$1" in
                \*.rpmsave|\*.rpmorig|\*.rpmnew|\*~|\*.orig)
                        continue;;
        esac
        \[ "$i" = "/etc/rc1.d/S00single" \] && continue
  # ==> Set script name, but don't execute it yet.
        $i start
done

  # ==> . . .

![Important](../images/important.gif)

The [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) of an **and list** or an **or list** is the exit status of the last command executed.

Clever combinations of _and_ and _or_ lists are possible, but the logic may easily become convoluted and require close attention to [operator precedence rules](#OPPRECEDENCE1), and possibly extensive debugging.

false && true || echo false         # false

# Same result as
( false && true ) || echo false     # false
# But NOT
false && ( true || echo false )     # (nothing echoed)

#  Note left-to-right grouping and evaluation of statements.

#  It's usually best to avoid such complexities.

#  Thanks, S.C.

See [Example A-7](#DAYSBETWEEN) and [Example 7-4](#BROKENLINK) for illustrations of using **and / or list** constructs to test variables.

Chapter 27. Arrays
==================

Newer versions of Bash support one-dimensional arrays. Array elements may be initialized with the **variable\[xx\]** notation. Alternatively, a script may introduce the entire array by an explicit **declare -a variable** statement. To dereference (retrieve the contents of) an array element, use _curly bracket_ notation, that is, **${element\[xx\]}**.

**Example 27-1. Simple array usage**

#!/bin/bash


area\[11\]=23
area\[13\]=37
area\[51\]=UFOs

#  Array members need not be consecutive or contiguous.

#  Some members of the array can be left uninitialized.
#  Gaps in the array are okay.
#  In fact, arrays with sparse data ("sparse arrays")
#+ are useful in spreadsheet-processing software.


echo -n "area\[11\] = "
echo ${area\[11\]}    #  {curly brackets} needed.

echo -n "area\[13\] = "
echo ${area\[13\]}

echo "Contents of area\[51\] are ${area\[51\]}."

# Contents of uninitialized array variable print blank (null variable).
echo -n "area\[43\] = "
echo ${area\[43\]}
echo "(area\[43\] unassigned)"

echo

# Sum of two array variables assigned to third
area\[5\]=\`expr ${area\[11\]} + ${area\[13\]}\`
echo "area\[5\] = area\[11\] + area\[13\]"
echo -n "area\[5\] = "
echo ${area\[5\]}

area\[6\]=\`expr ${area\[11\]} + ${area\[51\]}\`
echo "area\[6\] = area\[11\] + area\[51\]"
echo -n "area\[6\] = "
echo ${area\[6\]}
# This fails because adding an integer to a string is not permitted.

echo; echo; echo

# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Another array, "area2".
# Another way of assigning array variables...
# array\_name=( XXX YYY ZZZ ... )

area2=( zero one two three four )

echo -n "area2\[0\] = "
echo ${area2\[0\]}
# Aha, zero-based indexing (first element of array is \[0\], not \[1\]).

echo -n "area2\[1\] = "
echo ${area2\[1\]}    # \[1\] is second element of array.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

echo; echo; echo

# -----------------------------------------------
# Yet another array, "area3".
# Yet another way of assigning array variables...
# array\_name=(\[xx\]=XXX \[yy\]=YYY ...)

area3=(\[17\]=seventeen \[24\]=twenty-four)

echo -n "area3\[17\] = "
echo ${area3\[17\]}

echo -n "area3\[24\] = "
echo ${area3\[24\]}
# -----------------------------------------------

exit 0

As we have seen, a convenient way of initializing an entire array is the array=( element1 element2 ... elementN ) notation.

base64\_charset=( {A..Z} {a..z} {0..9} + / = )
               #  Using extended brace expansion
               #+ to initialize the elements of the array.                
               #  Excerpted from vladz's "base64.sh" script
               #+ in the "Contributed Scripts" appendix.

Bash permits array operations on variables, even if the variables are not explicitly declared as arrays.

string=abcABC123ABCabc
echo ${string\[@\]}               # abcABC123ABCabc
echo ${string\[\*\]}               # abcABC123ABCabc 
echo ${string\[0\]}               # abcABC123ABCabc
echo ${string\[1\]}               # No output!
                                # Why?
echo ${#string\[@\]}              # 1
                                # One element in the array.
                                # The string itself.

# Thank you, Michael Zick, for pointing this out.

Once again this demonstrates that [Bash variables are untyped](#BVUNTYPED).

**Example 27-2. Formatting a poem**

#!/bin/bash
# poem.sh: Pretty-prints one of the ABS Guide author's favorite poems.

# Lines of the poem (single stanza).
Line\[1\]="I do not know which to prefer,"
Line\[2\]="The beauty of inflections"
Line\[3\]="Or the beauty of innuendoes,"
Line\[4\]="The blackbird whistling"
Line\[5\]="Or just after."
# Note that quoting permits embedding whitespace.

# Attribution.
Attrib\[1\]=" Wallace Stevens"
Attrib\[2\]="\\"Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird\\""
# This poem is in the Public Domain (copyright expired).

echo

tput bold   # Bold print.

for index in 1 2 3 4 5    # Five lines.
do
  printf "     %s\\n" "${Line\[index\]}"
done

for index in 1 2          # Two attribution lines.
do
  printf "          %s\\n" "${Attrib\[index\]}"
done

Array variables have a syntax all their own, and even standard Bash commands and operators have special options adapted for array use.

**Example 27-3. Various array operations**

#!/bin/bash

echo ${array:1}        #  ero
                       #  Parameter expansion of first element,
                       #+ starting at position # 1 (2nd character).

echo "--------------"

echo ${#array}         #  4
                       #  Length of first element of array.
                       #  (Alternate notation)

echo ${#array\[1\]}      #  3
                       #  Length of second element of array.
                       #  Arrays in Bash have zero-based indexing.

#    A function writes its output (if echo-ed) to stdout.
#    Assignment, in conjunction with "echo" and command substitution,

#    The name\[@\] notation specifies (the equivalent of) a "for-each"
#+   operation.
#  Bash is more powerful than you think!

[Command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF) can construct the individual elements of an array.

# Exercise:
# --------
#  Modify this script so it lists itself
#+ in its original format,
#+ complete with whitespace, line breaks, etc.

In an array context, some Bash [builtins](#BUILTINREF) have a slightly altered meaning. For example, [unset](#UNSETREF) deletes array elements, or even an entire array.

**Example 27-6. Some special properties of arrays**

#!/bin/bash

declare -a colors
#  All subsequent commands in this script will treat
#+ the variable "colors" as an array.

echo "Enter your favorite colors (separated from each other by a space)."

read -a colors    # Enter at least 3 colors to demonstrate features below.
#  Special option to 'read' command,
#+ allowing assignment of elements in an array.

echo

element\_count=${#colors\[@\]}
# Special syntax to extract number of elements in array.
#     element\_count=${#colors\[\*\]} works also.
#
#  The "@" variable allows word splitting within quotes
#+ (extracts variables separated by whitespace).
#
#  This corresponds to the behavior of "$@" and "$\*"
#+ in positional parameters. 

index=0

while \[ "$index" -lt "$element\_count" \]
do    # List all the elements in the array.
  echo ${colors\[$index\]}
  #    ${colors\[index\]} also works because it's within ${ ... } brackets.
  let "index = $index + 1"
  # Or:
  #    ((index++))
done
# Each array element listed on a separate line.
# If this is not desired, use  echo -n "${colors\[$index\]} "
#
# Doing it with a "for" loop instead:
#   for i in "${colors\[@\]}"
#   do
#     echo "$i"
#   done
# (Thanks, S.C.)

echo

# Again, list all the elements in the array, but using a more elegant method.
  echo ${colors\[@\]}          # echo ${colors\[\*\]} also works.

echo

# The "unset" command deletes elements of an array, or entire array.
unset colors\[1\]              # Remove 2nd element of array.
                             # Same effect as   colors\[1\]=
echo  ${colors\[@\]}           # List array again, missing 2nd element.

unset colors                 # Delete entire array.
                             #  unset colors\[\*\] and
                             #+ unset colors\[@\] also work.
echo; echo -n "Colors gone."			   
echo ${colors\[@\]}            # List array again, now empty.

exit 0

As seen in the previous example, either **${array\_name\[@\]}** or **${array\_name\[\*\]}** refers to _all_ the elements of the array. Similarly, to get a count of the number of elements in an array, use either **${#array\_name\[@\]}** or **${#array\_name\[\*\]}**. **${#array\_name}** is the length (number of characters) of **${array\_name\[0\]}**, the first element of the array.

array3=( ${array0\[@\]:1:2} )
echo
echo "Elements in array3:  ${array3\[@\]}"

# Works like a string (array of characters).
# Try some other "string" forms.

# Replacement:
array4=( ${array0\[@\]/second/2nd} )

echo "Elements in array4:  ${array4\[@\]}"

# Replace all matching wildcarded string.
array5=( ${array0\[@\]//new?/old} )

# Just when you are getting the feel for this . . .

array7=( ${array0\[@\]#new1} )

# Which looks a lot like . . .
array8=( ${array0\[@\]/new1/} )
echo
echo "Elements in array8:  ${array8\[@\]}"

#  So what can one say about this?

#  The string operations are performed on
#+ each of the elements in var\[@\] in succession.
#  Therefore : Bash supports string vector operations.
#  If the result is a zero length string,
#+ that element disappears in the resulting assignment.
#  However, if the expansion is in quotes, the null elements remain.

#  Michael Zick:    Question, are those strings hard or soft quotes?
#  Nathan Coulter:  There is no such thing as "soft quotes."
#!    What's really happening is that
#!+   the pattern matching happens after
#!+   all the other expansions of \[word\]
#!+   in cases like ${parameter#word}.

array9=( ${array0\[@\]/$zap/} )
echo
echo "Number of elements in array9:  ${#array9\[@\]}"

# This time the null elements remain.
echo "Number of elements in array9:  ${#array9\[@\]}"


# Just when you thought you were still in Kansas . . .
array10=( ${array0\[@\]#$zap} )
echo
echo "Elements in array10:  ${array10\[@\]}"
# But, the asterisk in zap won't be interpreted if quoted.
array10=( ${array0\[@\]#"$zap"} )
echo
echo "Elements in array10:  ${array10\[@\]}"
# Well, maybe we \_are\_ still in Kansas . . .
# (Revisions to above code block by Nathan Coulter.)


#  Compare array7 with array10.
#  Compare array8 with array9.

#  Reiterating: No such thing as soft quotes!
#  Nathan Coulter explains:
#  Pattern matching of 'word' in ${parameter#word} is done after
#+ parameter expansion and \*before\* quote removal.
#  In the normal case, pattern matching is done \*after\* quote removal.

The relationship of **${array\_name\[@\]}** and **${array\_name\[\*\]}** is analogous to that between [$@ and $\*](#APPREF). This powerful array notation has a number of uses.

\# Copying an array.
array2=( "${array1\[@\]}" )
# or
array2="${array1\[@\]}"
#
#  However, this fails with "sparse" arrays,
#+ arrays with holes (missing elements) in them,
#+ as Jochen DeSmet points out.
# ------------------------------------------
  array1\[0\]=0
# array1\[1\] not assigned
  array1\[2\]=2

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

The **array=( element1 element2 ... elementN )** initialization operation, with the help of [command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF), makes it possible to load the contents of a text file into an array.

#!/bin/bash

filename=sample\_file

#            cat sample\_file
#
#            1 a b c
#            2 d e fg


declare -a array1

array1=( \`cat "$filename"\`)                #  Loads contents
#         List file to stdout              #+ of $filename into array1.
#
#  array1=( \`cat "$filename" | tr '\\n' ' '\`)
#                            change linefeeds in file to spaces. 
#  Not necessary because Bash does word splitting,
#+ changing linefeeds to spaces.

echo ${array1\[@\]}            # List the array.
#                              1 a b c 2 d e fg
#
#  Each whitespace-separated "word" in the file
#+ has been assigned to an element of the array.

element\_count=${#array1\[\*\]}
echo $element\_count          # 8

Clever scripting makes it possible to add array operations.

# Output format of the 'times' command:

#  Bash has two versions of assigning all elements of an array

#  Both drop 'null reference' elements
#+ in Bash versions 2.04 and later.
#  An additional array assignment that maintains the relationship of
#+ \[subscript\]=value for arrays may be added to newer versions.

#  Constructs a large array using an internal command,

#+ will do just fine.

declare -a bigOne=( /dev/\* )  # All the files in /dev . . .

echo '- - testing: =${array\[@\]} - -'
times
declare -a bigThree=${bigOne\[@\]}
# No parentheses this time.
times

#  Comparing the numbers shows that the second form, pointed out
#+ by Stephane Chazelas, is faster.
#
#  As William Park explains:
#+ The bigTwo array assigned element by element (because of parentheses),
#+ whereas bigThree assigned as a single string.
#  So, in essence, you have:
#                   bigTwo=( \[0\]="..." \[1\]="..." \[2\]="..." ... )
#                   bigThree=( \[0\]="... ... ..." )
#
#  Verify this by:  echo ${bigTwo\[0\]}
#                   echo ${bigThree\[0\]}


#  I will continue to use the first form in my example descriptions
#+ because I think it is a better illustration of what is happening.

#  The reusable portions of my examples will actual contain
#+ the second form where appropriate because of the speedup.

# MSZ: Sorry about that earlier oversight folks.


#  Note:
#  ----
#  The "declare -a" statements in lines 32 and 44
#+ are not strictly necessary, since it is implicit
#+ in the  Array=( ... )  assignment form.
#  However, eliminating these declarations slows down
#+ the execution of the following sections of the script.
#  Try it, and see.

#  At the end of the second pass, the next "heaviest" one has sunk next to bottom.
#  And so forth.

Arrays enable implementing a shell script version of the _Sieve of Eratosthenes_. Of course, a resource-intensive application of this nature should really be written in a compiled language, such as C. It runs excruciatingly slowly as a script.

Arrays lend themselves, to some extent, to emulating data structures for which Bash has no native support.

**Example 27-15. Emulating a push-down stack**

#!/bin/bash
# stack.sh: push-down stack simulation

#  Similar to the CPU stack, a push-down stack stores data items
#+ sequentially, but releases them in reverse order, last-in first-out.

Data=             #  Contents of stack location.  
                  #  Must use global variable,
                  #+ because of limitation on function return range.

Fancy manipulation of array "subscripts" may require intermediate variables. For projects involving this, again consider using a more powerful programming language, such as Perl or C.

**Example 27-16. Complex array application: _Exploring a weird mathematical series_**

#  This is a "chaotic" integer series with strange
#+ and unpredictable behavior.
#  The first 20 terms of the series are:
#  1 1 2 3 3 4 5 5 6 6 6 8 8 8 10 9 10 11 11 12 

#  See Hofstadter's book, \_Goedel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid\_,

do   # Q\[n\] = Q\[n - Q\[n-1\]\] + Q\[n - Q\[n-2\]\]  for n>2
#    Need to break the expression into intermediate terms,
#+   since Bash doesn't handle complex array arithmetic very well.

  let "n1 = $n - 1"        # n-1

Chapter 28. Indirect References
===============================

We have seen that [referencing a variable](#VARSUBN), $var, fetches its _value_. But, what about the _value of a value_? What about $$var?

The actual notation is _\\$$var_, usually preceded by an [eval](#EVALREF) (and sometimes an [echo](#ECHOREF)). This is called an _indirect reference_.

**Example 28-1. Indirect Variable References**

#!/bin/bash
# ind-ref.sh: Indirect variable referencing.
# Accessing the contents of the contents of a variable.

# First, let's fool around a little.

var=23

echo "\\$var   = $var"           # $var   = 23
# So far, everything as expected. But ...

echo "\\$\\$var  = $$var"         # $$var  = 4570var
#  Not useful ...
#  \\$\\$ expanded to PID of the script
#  -- refer to the entry on the $$ variable --
#+ and "var" is echoed as plain text.
#  (Thank you, Jakob Bohm, for pointing this out.)

echo "\\\\\\$\\$var = \\$$var"       # \\$$var = $23
#  As expected. The first $ is escaped and pasted on to
#+ the value of var ($var = 23 ).
#  Meaningful, but still not useful. 

# Now, let's start over and do it the right way.

# ============================================== #


a=letter\_of\_alphabet   # Variable "a" holds the name of another variable.
letter\_of\_alphabet=z

echo

# Direct reference.
echo "a = $a"          # a = letter\_of\_alphabet

# Indirect reference.
  eval a=\\$$a
# ^^^        Forcing an eval(uation), and ...
#        ^   Escaping the first $ ...
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The 'eval' forces an update of $a, sets it to the updated value of \\$$a.
# So, we see why 'eval' so often shows up in indirect reference notation.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  echo "Now a = $a"    # Now a = z

echo


# Now, let's try changing the second-order reference.

t=table\_cell\_3
table\_cell\_3=24
echo "\\"table\_cell\_3\\" = $table\_cell\_3"            # "table\_cell\_3" = 24
echo -n "dereferenced \\"t\\" = "; eval echo \\$$t    # dereferenced "t" = 24
# In this simple case, the following also works (why?).
#         eval t=\\$$t; echo "\\"t\\" = $t"

echo

t=table\_cell\_3
NEW\_VAL=387
table\_cell\_3=$NEW\_VAL
echo "Changing value of \\"table\_cell\_3\\" to $NEW\_VAL."
echo "\\"table\_cell\_3\\" now $table\_cell\_3"
echo -n "dereferenced \\"t\\" now "; eval echo \\$$t
# "eval" takes the two arguments "echo" and "\\$$t" (set equal to $table\_cell\_3)


echo

# (Thanks, Stephane Chazelas, for clearing up the above behavior.)


#   A more straightforward method is the ${!t} notation, discussed in the
#+ "Bash, version 2" section.
#   See also ex78.sh.

exit 0

Indirect referencing in Bash is a multi-step process. First, take the name of a variable: varname. Then, reference it: $varname. Then, reference the reference: $$varname. Then, _escape_ the first $: \\$$varname. Finally, force a reevaluation of the expression and assign it: **eval newvar=\\$$varname**.

Of what practical use is indirect referencing of variables? It gives Bash a little of the functionality of [pointers](#POINTERREF) in _C_, for instance, in [table lookup](#RESISTOR). And, it also has some other very interesting applications. . . .

Nils Radtke shows how to build "dynamic" variable names and evaluate their contents. This can be useful when [sourcing](#SOURCEREF) configuration files.

#!/bin/bash


# ---------------------------------------------
# This could be "sourced" from a separate file.
isdnMyProviderRemoteNet=172.16.0.100
isdnYourProviderRemoteNet=10.0.0.10
isdnOnlineService="MyProvider"
# ---------------------------------------------
      

remoteNet=$(eval "echo \\$$(echo isdn${isdnOnlineService}RemoteNet)")
remoteNet=$(eval "echo \\$$(echo isdnMyProviderRemoteNet)")
remoteNet=$(eval "echo \\$isdnMyProviderRemoteNet")
remoteNet=$(eval "echo $isdnMyProviderRemoteNet")

echo "$remoteNet"    # 172.16.0.100

# ================================================================

#  And, it gets even better.

#  Consider the following snippet given a variable named getSparc,
#+ but no such variable getIa64:

chkMirrorArchs () { 
  arch="$1";
  if \[ "$(eval "echo \\${$(echo get$(echo -ne $arch |
       sed 's/^\\(.\\).\*/\\1/g' | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'; echo $arch |
       sed 's/^.\\(.\*\\)/\\1/g')):-false}")" = true \]
  then
     return 0;
  else
     return 1;
  fi;
}

getSparc="true"
unset getIa64
chkMirrorArchs sparc
echo $?        # 0
               # True

chkMirrorArchs Ia64
echo $?        # 1
               # False

# Notes:
# -----
# Even the to-be-substituted variable name part is built explicitly.
# The parameters to the chkMirrorArchs calls are all lower case.
# The variable name is composed of two parts: "get" and "Sparc" . . .

**Example 28-2. Passing an indirect reference to _awk_**

#!/bin/bash

#  Another version of the "column totaler" script
#+ that adds up a specified column (of numbers) in the target file.
#  This one uses indirect references.

ARGS=2
E\_WRONGARGS=85

if \[ $# -ne "$ARGS" \] # Check for proper number of command-line args.
then
   echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` filename column-number"
   exit $E\_WRONGARGS
fi

filename=$1         # Name of file to operate on.
column\_number=$2    # Which column to total up.

#===== Same as original script, up to this point =====#


# A multi-line awk script is invoked by
#   awk "
#   ...
#   ...
#   ...
#   "


# Begin awk script.
# -------------------------------------------------
awk "

{ total += \\$${column\_number} # Indirect reference
}
END {
     print total
     }

     " "$filename"
# Note that awk doesn't need an eval preceding \\$$.
# -------------------------------------------------
# End awk script.

#  Indirect variable reference avoids the hassles
#+ of referencing a shell variable within the embedded awk script.
#  Thanks, Stephane Chazelas.


exit $?

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

This method of indirect referencing is a bit tricky. If the second order variable changes its value, then the first order variable must be properly dereferenced (as in the above example). Fortunately, the _${!variable}_ notation introduced with [version 2](#BASH2REF) of Bash (see [Example 37-2](#EX78) and [Example A-22](#HASHEX2)) makes indirect referencing more intuitive.

Bash does not support pointer arithmetic, and this severely limits the usefulness of indirect referencing. In fact, indirect referencing in a scripting language is, at best, something of an afterthought.

Chapter 29. /dev and /proc
==========================

A Linux or UNIX filesystem typically has the /dev and /proc special-purpose directories.

* * *

29.1. /dev
==========

The /dev directory contains entries for the _physical devices_ that may or may not be present in the hardware. [\[118\]](#FTN.AEN19045) Appropriately enough, these are called _device files_. As an example, the hard drive partitions containing the mounted filesystem(s) have entries in /dev, as [df](#DFREF) shows.

Among other things, the /dev directory contains _loopback_ devices, such as /dev/loop0. A loopback device is a gimmick that allows an ordinary file to be accessed as if it were a block device. [\[119\]](#FTN.AEN19065) This permits mounting an entire filesystem within a single large file. See [Example 17-8](#CREATEFS) and [Example 17-7](#ISOMOUNTREF).

A few of the pseudo-devices in /dev have other specialized uses, such as [/dev/null](#ZEROSREF), [/dev/zero](#ZEROSREF1), [/dev/urandom](#URANDOMREF), /dev/sda1 (hard drive partition), /dev/udp (_User Datagram Packet_ port), and [/dev/tcp](#DEVTCP).

For instance:

To manually [mount](#MOUNTREF) a USB flash drive, append the following line to [/etc/fstab](#FSTABREF). [\[120\]](#FTN.AEN19093)

/dev/sda1    /mnt/flashdrive    auto    noauto,user,noatime    0 0

(See also [Example A-23](#USBINST).)

Checking whether a disk is in the CD-burner (soft-linked to /dev/hdc):

head -1 /dev/hdc


#  head: cannot open '/dev/hdc' for reading: No medium found
#  (No disc in the drive.)

#  head: error reading '/dev/hdc': Input/output error
#  (There is a disk in the drive, but it can't be read;
#+  possibly it's an unrecorded CDR blank.)   

#  Stream of characters and assorted gibberish
#  (There is a pre-recorded disk in the drive,
#+ and this is raw output -- a stream of ASCII and binary data.)
#  Here we see the wisdom of using 'head' to limit the output
#+ to manageable proportions, rather than 'cat' or something similar.


#  Now, it's just a matter of checking/parsing the output and taking
#+ appropriate action.

When executing a command on a /dev/tcp/$host/$port pseudo-device file, Bash opens a TCP connection to the associated _socket_.

A _socket_ is a communications node associated with a specific I/O port. (This is analogous to a _hardware socket_, or _receptacle_, for a connecting cable.) It permits data transfer between hardware devices on the same machine, between machines on the same network, between machines across different networks, and, of course, between machines at different locations on the Internet.

The following examples assume an active Internet connection.

Getting the time from nist.gov:

bash$ **cat </dev/tcp/time.nist.gov/13**
53082 04-03-18 04:26:54 68 0 0 502.3 UTC(NIST) \*
	      

\[Mark contributed this example.\]

Generalizing the above into a script:

#!/bin/bash
# This script must run with root permissions.

URL="time.nist.gov/13"

Time=$(cat </dev/tcp/"$URL")
UTC=$(echo "$Time" | awk '{print$3}')   # Third field is UTC (GMT) time.
# Exercise: modify this for different time zones.

echo "UTC Time = "$UTC""

Downloading a URL:

bash$ **exec 5<>/dev/tcp/www.net.cn/80**
bash$ **echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.0\\n" >&5**
bash$ **cat <&5**
	      

\[Thanks, Mark and Mihai Maties.\]

**Example 29-1. Using /dev/tcp for troubleshooting**

#!/bin/bash
# dev-tcp.sh: /dev/tcp redirection to check Internet connection.

# Script by Troy Engel.
# Used with permission.

TCP\_PORT=80                # Port 80 is http.
  
# Try to connect. (Somewhat similar to a 'ping' . . .) 
echo "HEAD / HTTP/1.0" >/dev/tcp/${TCP\_HOST}/${TCP\_PORT}
MYEXIT=$?

: <<EXPLANATION
If bash was compiled with --enable-net-redirections, it has the capability of
using a special character device for both TCP and UDP redirections. These
redirections are used identically as STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR. The device entries
are 30,36 for /dev/tcp:

  mknod /dev/tcp c 30 36

>From the bash reference:
/dev/tcp/host/port
    If host is a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is an integer
port number or service name, Bash attempts to open a TCP connection to the
corresponding socket.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

It is even possible to control certain peripherals with commands sent to the /proc directory.

	  root# **echo on > /proc/acpi/ibm/light**
          

This turns on the _Thinklight_ in certain models of IBM/Lenovo Thinkpads. (May not work on all Linux distros.)

Of course, caution is advised when writing to /proc.

The /proc directory contains subdirectories with unusual numerical names. Every one of these names maps to the [process ID](#PPIDREF) of a currently running process. Within each of these subdirectories, there are a number of files that hold useful information about the corresponding process. The stat and status files keep running statistics on the process, the cmdline file holds the command-line arguments the process was invoked with, and the exe file is a symbolic link to the complete path name of the invoking process. There are a few more such files, but these seem to be the most interesting from a scripting standpoint.

**Example 29-3. Finding the process associated with a PID**

#!/bin/bash
# pid-identifier.sh:
# Gives complete path name to process associated with pid.

ARGNO=1  # Number of arguments the script expects.
E\_WRONGARGS=65
E\_BADPID=66
E\_NOSUCHPROCESS=67
E\_NOPERMISSION=68
PROCFILE=exe

if \[ $# -ne $ARGNO \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` PID-number" >&2  # Error message >stderr.
  exit $E\_WRONGARGS
fi  

pidno=$( ps ax | grep $1 | awk '{ print $1 }' | grep $1 )
# Checks for pid in "ps" listing, field #1.
# Then makes sure it is the actual process, not the process invoked by this script.
# The last "grep $1" filters out this possibility.
#
#    pidno=$( ps ax | awk '{ print $1 }' | grep $1 )
#    also works, as Teemu Huovila, points out.

if \[ -z "$pidno" \]  #  If, after all the filtering, the result is a zero-length string,
then                #+ no running process corresponds to the pid given.
  echo "No such process running."
  exit $E\_NOSUCHPROCESS
fi  

# Alternatively:
#   if ! ps $1 > /dev/null 2>&1
#   then                # no running process corresponds to the pid given.
#     echo "No such process running."
#     exit $E\_NOSUCHPROCESS
#    fi

# To simplify the entire process, use "pidof".


if \[ ! -r "/proc/$1/$PROCFILE" \]  # Check for read permission.
then
  echo "Process $1 running, but..."
  echo "Can't get read permission on /proc/$1/$PROCFILE."
  exit $E\_NOPERMISSION  # Ordinary user can't access some files in /proc.
fi  

# The last two tests may be replaced by:
#    if ! kill -0 $1 > /dev/null 2>&1 # '0' is not a signal, but
                                      # this will test whether it is possible
                                      # to send a signal to the process.
#    then echo "PID doesn't exist or you're not its owner" >&2
#    exit $E\_BADPID
#    fi



exe\_file=$( ls -l /proc/$1 | grep "exe" | awk '{ print $11 }' )
# Or       exe\_file=$( ls -l /proc/$1/exe | awk '{print $11}' )
#
#  /proc/pid-number/exe is a symbolic link
#+ to the complete path name of the invoking process.

if \[ -e "$exe\_file" \]  #  If /proc/pid-number/exe exists,
then                   #+ then the corresponding process exists.
  echo "Process #$1 invoked by $exe\_file."
else
  echo "No such process running."
fi  


#  This elaborate script can \*almost\* be replaced by
#       ps ax | grep $1 | awk '{ print $5 }'
#  However, this will not work...
#+ because the fifth field of 'ps' is argv\[0\] of the process,
#+ not the executable file path.
#
# However, either of the following would work.
#       find /proc/$1/exe -printf '%l\\n'
#       lsof -aFn -p $1 -d txt | sed -ne 's/^n//p'

# Finding the process number of 'pppd', the 'ppp daemon'.
# Have to filter out the process lines generated by the search itself.
#
#  However, as Oleg Philon points out,
#+ this could have been considerably simplified by using "pidof".
#  pidno=$( pidof $PROCNAME )
#
#  Moral of the story:

In general, it is dangerous to _write_ to the files in /proc, as this can corrupt the filesystem or crash the machine.

A Linux system has quite a number of tools for accessing, manipulating, and troubleshooting network connections. We can incorporate some of these tools into scripts -- scripts that expand our knowledge of networking, useful scripts that can facilitate the administration of a network.

Here is a simple CGI script that demonstrates connecting to a remote server.

**Example 30-1. Print the server environment**

#!/bin/bash
# test-cgi.sh
# by Michael Zick
# Used with permission

# May have to change the location for your site.
# (At the ISP's servers, Bash may not be in the usual place.)
# Other places: /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin
# Might even try it without any path in sha-bang.

# Disable filename globbing.
set -f

# Header tells browser what to expect.

For security purposes, it may be helpful to identify the IP addresses a computer is accessing.

**Example 30-2. IP addresses**

#!/bin/bash
# ip-addresses.sh
# List the IP addresses your computer is connected to.

#  Inspired by Greg Bledsoe's ddos.sh script,
#  Linux Journal, 09 March 2011.
#    URL:
#  http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/back-dead-simple-bash-complex-ddos
#  Greg licensed his script under the GPL2,
#+ and as a derivative, this script is likewise GPL2.

connection\_type=TCP      # Also try UDP.
field=2           # Which field of the output we're interested in.
no\_match=LISTEN   # Filter out records containing this. Why?
lsof\_args=-ni     # -i lists Internet-associated files.
                  # -n preserves numerical IP addresses.
		  # What happens without the -n option? Try it.
router="\[0-9\]\[0-9\]\[0-9\]\[0-9\]\[0-9\]->"
#       Delete the router info.

lsof "$lsof\_args" | grep $connection\_type | grep -v "$no\_match" |
      awk '{print $9}' | cut -d : -f $field | sort | uniq |
      sed s/"^$router"//

#  Bledsoe's script assigns the output of a filtered IP list,
#  (similar to lines 19-22, above) to a variable.
#  He checks for multiple connections to a single IP address,
#  then uses:
#
#    iptables -I INPUT -s $ip -p tcp -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
#
#  ... within a 60-second delay loop to bounce packets from DDOS attacks.


#  Exercise:
#  --------
#  Use the 'iptables' command to extend this script
#+ to reject connection attempts from well-known spammer IP domains.

Chapter 31. Of Zeros and Nulls
==============================

Â 

_

_Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly null_

_Dead perfection; no more._

_\--Alfred Lord Tennyson_

_

**/dev/zero ... /dev/null**

Uses of /dev/null

Think of /dev/null as a _black hole_. It is essentially the equivalent of a write-only file. Everything written to it disappears. Attempts to read or output from it result in nothing. All the same, /dev/null can be quite useful from both the command-line and in scripts.

Suppressing stdout.

cat $filename >/dev/null
# Contents of the file will not list to stdout.

Suppressing stderr (from [Example 16-3](#EX57)).

rm $badname 2>/dev/null
#           So error messages \[stderr\] deep-sixed.

Suppressing output from _both_ stdout and stderr.

cat $filename 2>/dev/null >/dev/null
# If "$filename" does not exist, there will be no error message output.
# If "$filename" does exist, the contents of the file will not list to stdout.
# Therefore, no output at all will result from the above line of code.
#
#  This can be useful in situations where the return code from a command
#+ needs to be tested, but no output is desired.
#
# cat $filename &>/dev/null
#     also works, as Baris Cicek points out.

Deleting contents of a file, but preserving the file itself, with all attendant permissions (from [Example 2-1](#EX1) and [Example 2-3](#EX2)):

cat /dev/null > /var/log/messages
#  : > /var/log/messages   has same effect, but does not spawn a new process.

cat /dev/null > /var/log/wtmp

Automatically emptying the contents of a logfile (especially good for dealing with those nasty "cookies" sent by commercial Web sites):

**Example 31-1. Hiding the cookie jar**

\# Obsolete Netscape browser.
# Same principle applies to newer browsers.

if \[ -f ~/.netscape/cookies \]  # Remove, if exists.
then
  rm -f ~/.netscape/cookies
fi

ln -s /dev/null ~/.netscape/cookies
# All cookies now get sent to a black hole, rather than saved to disk.

Uses of /dev/zero

Like /dev/null, /dev/zero is a pseudo-device file, but it actually produces a stream of nulls (_binary_ zeros, not the [ASCII](#ASCIIDEF) kind). Output written to /dev/zero disappears, and it is fairly difficult to actually read the nulls emitted there, though it can be done with [od](#ODREF) or a hex editor. The chief use of /dev/zero is creating an initialized dummy file of predetermined length intended as a temporary swap file.

**Example 31-2. Setting up a swapfile using /dev/zero**

#!/bin/bash
# Creating a swap file.

#  A swap file provides a temporary storage cache
#+ which helps speed up certain filesystem operations.

ROOT\_UID=0         # Root has $UID 0.
E\_WRONG\_USER=85    # Not root?

FILE=/swap
BLOCKSIZE=1024
MINBLOCKS=40
SUCCESS=0


# This script must be run as root.
if \[ "$UID" -ne "$ROOT\_UID" \]

Another application of /dev/zero is to "zero out" a file of a designated size for a special purpose, such as mounting a filesystem on a [loopback device](#LOOPBACKREF) (see [Example 17-8](#CREATEFS)) or "securely" deleting a file (see [Example 16-61](#BLOTOUT)).

**Example 31-3. Creating a ramdisk**

#!/bin/bash
# ramdisk.sh

#  A "ramdisk" is a segment of system RAM memory
#+ which acts as if it were a filesystem.
#  Its advantage is very fast access (read/write time).
#  Disadvantages: volatility, loss of data on reboot or powerdown,
#+                less RAM available to system.
#
#  Of what use is a ramdisk?
#  Keeping a large dataset, such as a table or dictionary on ramdisk,
#+ speeds up data lookup, since memory access is much faster than disk access.

In addition to all the above, /dev/zero is needed by ELF (_Executable and Linking Format_) UNIX/Linux binaries.

Chapter 32. Debugging
=====================

Â 

_

_Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it._

_\--Brian Kernighan_

_

The Bash shell contains no built-in debugger, and only bare-bones debugging-specific commands and constructs. Syntax errors or outright typos in the script generate cryptic error messages that are often of no help in debugging a non-functional script.

**Example 32-1. A buggy script**

#!/bin/bash
# ex74.sh

# This is a buggy script.
# Where, oh where is the error?

a=37

if \[$a -gt 27 \]
then
  echo $a
fi  

exit $?   # 0! Why?

Output from script:

./ex74.sh: \[37: command not found

What's wrong with the above script? Hint: after the _if_.

**Example 32-2. Missing [keyword](#KEYWORDREF)**

#!/bin/bash
# missing-keyword.sh
# What error message will this script generate? And why?

for a in 1 2 3
do
  echo "$a"
# done     # Required keyword 'done' commented out in line 8.

exit 0     # Will not exit here!

# === #

# From command line, after script terminates:
  echo $?    # 2

Output from script:

missing-keyword.sh: line 10: syntax error: unexpected end of file
	

Note that the error message does _not_ necessarily reference the line in which the error occurs, but the line where the Bash interpreter finally becomes aware of the error.

Error messages may disregard comment lines in a script when reporting the line number of a syntax error.

What if the script executes, but does not work as expected? This is the all too familiar logic error.

**Example 32-3. _test24_: another buggy script**

#!/bin/bash

#  This script is supposed to delete all filenames in current directory
#+ containing embedded spaces.
#  It doesn't work.
#  Why not?


badname=\`ls | grep ' '\`

# Try this:
# echo "$badname"

rm "$badname"

exit 0

Try to find out what's wrong with [Example 32-3](#EX75) by uncommenting the **echo "$badname"** line. Echo statements are useful for seeing whether what you expect is actually what you get.

In this particular case, **rm "$badname"** will not give the desired results because $badname should not be quoted. Placing it in quotes ensures that **rm** has only one argument (it will match only one filename). A partial fix is to remove to quotes from $badname and to reset $IFS to contain only a newline, **IFS=$'\\n'**. However, there are simpler ways of going about it.

\# Correct methods of deleting filenames containing spaces.
rm \*\\ \*
rm \*" "\*
rm \*' '\*
# Thank you. S.C.

Summarizing the symptoms of a buggy script,

1.  It bombs with a "syntax error" message, or
    
2.  It runs, but does not work as expected (logic error).
    
3.  It runs, works as expected, but has nasty side effects (logic bomb).
    

Tools for debugging non-working scripts include

1.  Inserting [echo](#ECHOREF) statements at critical points in the script to trace the variables, and otherwise give a snapshot of what is going on.
    
    ![Tip](../images/tip.gif)
    
    Even better is an **echo** that echoes only when _debug_ is on.
    
    \### debecho (debug-echo), by Stefano Falsetto ###
    ### Will echo passed parameters only if DEBUG is set to a value. ###
    debecho () {
      if \[ ! -z "$DEBUG" \]; then
         echo "$1" >&2
         #         ^^^ to stderr
      fi
    }
    
    DEBUG=on
    Whatever=whatnot
    debecho $Whatever   # whatnot
    
    DEBUG=
    Whatever=notwhat
    debecho $Whatever   # (Will not echo.)
    
2.  Using the [tee](#TEEREF) filter to check processes or data flows at critical points.
    
3.  Setting option flags \-n -v -x
    
    **sh -n scriptname** checks for syntax errors without actually running the script. This is the equivalent of inserting **set -n** or **set -o noexec** into the script. Note that certain types of syntax errors can slip past this check.
    
    **sh -v scriptname** echoes each command before executing it. This is the equivalent of inserting **set -v** or **set -o verbose** in the script.
    
    The \-n and \-v flags work well together. **sh -nv scriptname** gives a verbose syntax check.
    
    **sh -x scriptname** echoes the result each command, but in an abbreviated manner. This is the equivalent of inserting **set -x** or **set -o xtrace** in the script.
    
    Inserting **set -u** or **set -o nounset** in the script runs it, but gives an unbound variable error message and aborts the script.
    
    set -u   # Or   set -o nounset
    
    # Setting a variable to null will not trigger the error/abort.
    # unset\_var=
    
    echo $unset\_var   # Unset (and undeclared) variable.
    
    echo "Should not echo!"
    
    # sh t2.sh
    # t2.sh: line 6: unset\_var: unbound variable
    
4.  Using an "assert" function to test a variable or condition at critical points in a script. (This is an idea borrowed from C.)
    
    **Example 32-4. Testing a condition with an _assert_**
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # assert.sh
    
    #######################################################################
    assert ()                 #  If condition false,
    {                         #+ exit from script
                              #+ with appropriate error message.
      E\_PARAM\_ERR=98
      E\_ASSERT\_FAILED=99
    
    
      if \[ -z "$2" \]          #  Not enough parameters passed
      then                    #+ to assert() function.
        return $E\_PARAM\_ERR   #  No damage done.
      fi
    
      lineno=$2
    
      if \[ ! $1 \] 
      then
        echo "Assertion failed:  \\"$1\\""
        echo "File \\"$0\\", line $lineno"    # Give name of file and line number.
        exit $E\_ASSERT\_FAILED
      # else
      #   return
      #   and continue executing the script.
      fi  
    } # Insert a similar assert() function into a script you need to debug.    
    #######################################################################
    
    
    a=5
    b=4
    condition="$a -lt $b"     #  Error message and exit from script.
                              #  Try setting "condition" to something else
                              #+ and see what happens.
    
    assert "$condition" $LINENO
    # The remainder of the script executes only if the "assert" does not fail.
    
    
    # Some commands.
    # Some more commands . . .
    echo "This statement echoes only if the \\"assert\\" does not fail."
    # . . .
    # More commands . . .
    
    exit $?
    
5.  Using the [$LINENO](#LINENOREF) variable and the [caller](#CALLERREF) builtin.
    
6.  Trapping at exit.
    
    The [exit](#EXITREF) command in a script triggers a signal 0, terminating the process, that is, the script itself. [\[122\]](#FTN.AEN19460) It is often useful to trap the _exit_, forcing a "printout" of variables, for example. The _trap_ must be the first command in the script.
    

**Trapping signals**

**trap**

Specifies an action on receipt of a signal; also useful for debugging.

A _signal_ is a message sent to a process, either by the kernel or another process, telling it to take some specified action (usually to terminate). For example, hitting a [Control-C](#CTLCREF) sends a user interrupt, an INT signal, to a running program.

_A simple instance:_

trap '' 2
# Ignore interrupt 2 (Control-C), with no action specified. 

trap 'echo "Control-C disabled."' 2
# Message when Control-C pressed.

**Example 32-5. Trapping at exit**

#!/bin/bash
# Hunting variables with a trap.

trap 'echo Variable Listing --- a = $a  b = $b' EXIT
#  EXIT is the name of the signal generated upon exit from a script.
#
#  The command specified by the "trap" doesn't execute until
#+ the appropriate signal is sent.

echo "This prints before the \\"trap\\" --"
echo "even though the script sees the \\"trap\\" first."
echo

a=39

b=36

exit 0
#  Note that commenting out the 'exit' command makes no difference,
#+ since the script exits in any case after running out of commands.

**Example 32-6. Cleaning up after **Control-C****

#!/bin/bash
# logon.sh: A quick 'n dirty script to check whether you are on-line yet.

umask 177  # Make sure temp files are not world readable.


TRUE=1
LOGFILE=/var/log/messages
#  Note that $LOGFILE must be readable
#+ (as root, chmod 644 /var/log/messages).
TEMPFILE=temp.$$
#  Create a "unique" temp file name, using process id of the script.
#     Using 'mktemp' is an alternative.
#     For example:
#     TEMPFILE=\`mktemp temp.XXXXXX\`
KEYWORD=address
#  At logon, the line "remote IP address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
#                      appended to /var/log/messages.
ONLINE=22
USER\_INTERRUPT=13
CHECK\_LINES=100
#  How many lines in log file to check.

trap 'rm -f $TEMPFILE; exit $USER\_INTERRUPT' TERM INT
#  Cleans up the temp file if script interrupted by control-c.

echo

while \[ $TRUE \]  #Endless loop.
do
  tail -n $CHECK\_LINES $LOGFILE> $TEMPFILE
  #  Saves last 100 lines of system log file as temp file.
  #  Necessary, since newer kernels generate many log messages at log on.
  search=\`grep $KEYWORD $TEMPFILE\`
  #  Checks for presence of the "IP address" phrase,
  #+ indicating a successful logon.

  if \[ ! -z "$search" \] #  Quotes necessary because of possible spaces.
  then
     echo "On-line"
     rm -f $TEMPFILE    #  Clean up temp file.
     exit $ONLINE
  else
     echo -n "."        #  The -n option to echo suppresses newline,
                        #+ so you get continuous rows of dots.
  fi

  sleep 1  
done  


#  Note: if you change the KEYWORD variable to "Exit",
#+ this script can be used while on-line
#+ to check for an unexpected logoff.

# Exercise: Change the script, per the above note,
#           and prettify it.

exit 0


# Nick Drage suggests an alternate method:

while true
  do ifconfig ppp0 | grep UP 1> /dev/null && echo "connected" && exit 0
  echo -n "."   # Prints dots (.....) until connected.
  sleep 2
done

# Problem: Hitting Control-C to terminate this process may be insufficient.
#+         (Dots may keep on echoing.)
# Exercise: Fix this.



# Stephane Chazelas has yet another alternative:

CHECK\_INTERVAL=1

while ! tail -n 1 "$LOGFILE" | grep -q "$KEYWORD"
do echo -n .
   sleep $CHECK\_INTERVAL
done
echo "On-line"

# Exercise: Discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses
#           of each of these various approaches.

**Example 32-7. A Simple Implementation of a Progress Bar**

#! /bin/bash
# progress-bar2.sh
# Author: Graham Ewart (with reformatting by ABS Guide author).
# Used in ABS Guide with permission (thanks!).

# Invoke this script with bash. It doesn't work with sh.

interval=1
long\_interval=10

{
     trap "exit" SIGUSR1
     sleep $interval; sleep $interval
     while true
     do
       echo -n '.'     # Use dots.
       sleep $interval
     done; } &         # Start a progress bar as a background process.

pid=$!
trap "echo !; kill -USR1 $pid; wait $pid"  EXIT        # To handle ^C.

echo -n 'Long-running process '
sleep $long\_interval
echo ' Finished!'

kill -USR1 $pid
wait $pid              # Stop the progress bar.
trap EXIT

exit $?

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The DEBUG argument to **trap** causes a specified action to execute after every command in a script. This permits tracing variables, for example.

**Example 32-8. Tracing a variable**

#!/bin/bash

trap 'echo "VARIABLE-TRACE> \\$variable = \\"$variable\\""' DEBUG
# Echoes the value of $variable after every command.

variable=29; line=$LINENO

echo "  Just initialized \\$variable to $variable in line number $line."

let "variable \*= 3"; line=$LINENO
echo "  Just multiplied \\$variable by 3 in line number $line."

exit 0

#  The "trap 'command1 . . . command2 . . .' DEBUG" construct is
#+ more appropriate in the context of a complex script,
#+ where inserting multiple "echo $variable" statements might be
#+ awkward and time-consuming.

# Thanks, Stephane Chazelas for the pointer.


Output of script:

VARIABLE-TRACE> $variable = ""
VARIABLE-TRACE> $variable = "29"
  Just initialized $variable to 29.
VARIABLE-TRACE> $variable = "29"
VARIABLE-TRACE> $variable = "87"
  Just multiplied $variable by 3.
VARIABLE-TRACE> $variable = "87"

Of course, the **trap** command has other uses aside from debugging, such as disabling certain keystrokes within a script (see [Example A-43](#STOPWATCH)).

I had the need to run a program, with specified options, on a number of
different files, using a SMP machine. So I thought \[I'd\] keep running
a specified number of processes and start a new one each time . . . one
of these terminates.

The "wait" instruction does not help, since it waits for a given process
or \*all\* process started in background. So I wrote \[this\] bash script
that can do the job, using the "trap" instruction.

**trap '' SIGNAL** (two adjacent apostrophes) disables SIGNAL for the remainder of the script. **trap SIGNAL** restores the functioning of SIGNAL once more. This is useful to protect a critical portion of a script from an undesirable interrupt.

Chapter 33. Options
===================

Options are settings that change shell and/or script behavior.

The [set](#SETREF) command enables options within a script. At the point in the script where you want the options to take effect, use **set -o option-name** or, in short form, **set -option-abbrev**. These two forms are equivalent.

      #!/bin/bash

      set -o verbose
      # Echoes all commands before executing.
      

      #!/bin/bash

      set -v
      # Exact same effect as above.
      

![Note](../images/note.gif)

To _disable_ an option within a script, use **set +o option-name** or **set +option-abbrev**.

      #!/bin/bash

      set -o verbose
      # Command echoing on.
      command
      ...
      command

      set +o verbose
      # Command echoing off.
      command
      # Not echoed.

      # Command echoing on.

      command

      set +v
      # Command echoing off.
      command

      exit 0
      

An alternate method of enabling options in a script is to specify them immediately following the _#!_ script header.

      #!/bin/bash -x
      #
      # Body of script follows.
      

It is also possible to enable script options from the command line. Some options that will not work with **set** are available this way. Among these are _\-i_, force script to run interactive.

**bash -v script-name**

**bash -o verbose script-name**

The following is a listing of some useful options. They may be specified in either abbreviated form (preceded by a single dash) or by complete name (preceded by a _double_ dash or by \-o).

Here are some (non-recommended!) scripting practices that will bring excitement into an otherwise dull life.

*   Assigning reserved words or characters to variable names.
    
    case=value0       # Causes problems.
    23skidoo=value1   # Also problems.
    # Variable names starting with a digit are reserved by the shell.
    # Try \_23skidoo=value1. Starting variables with an underscore is okay.
    
    # However . . .   using just an underscore will not work.
    \_=25
    echo $\_           # $\_ is a special variable set to last arg of last command.
    # But . . .       \_ is a valid function name!
    
    xyz((!\*=value2    # Causes severe problems.
    # As of version 3 of Bash, periods are not allowed within variable names.
    
*   Using a hyphen or other reserved characters in a variable name (or function name).
    
    var-1=23
    # Use 'var\_1' instead.
    
    function-whatever ()   # Error
    # Use 'function\_whatever ()' instead.
    
     
    # As of version 3 of Bash, periods are not allowed within function names.
    function.whatever ()   # Error
    # Use 'functionWhatever ()' instead.
    
*   Using the same name for a variable and a function. This can make a script difficult to understand.
    
    do\_something ()
    {
      echo "This function does something with \\"$1\\"."
    }
    
    do\_something=do\_something
    
    do\_something do\_something
    
    # All this is legal, but highly confusing.
    
*   Using [whitespace](#WHITESPACEREF) inappropriately. In contrast to other programming languages, Bash can be quite finicky about whitespace.
    
    var1 = 23   # 'var1=23' is correct.
    # On line above, Bash attempts to execute command "var1"
    # with the arguments "=" and "23".
    	
    let c = $a - $b   # Instead:   let c=$a-$b   or   let "c = $a - $b"
    
    if \[ $a -le 5\]    # if \[ $a -le 5 \]   is correct.
    #           ^^      if \[ "$a" -le 5 \]   is even better.
                      # \[\[ $a -le 5 \]\] also works.
    
*   Not terminating with a [semicolon](#SEMICOLONREF) the final command in a [code block within curly brackets](#CODEBLOCKREF).
    
    { ls -l; df; echo "Done." }
    # bash: syntax error: unexpected end of file
    
    { ls -l; df; echo "Done."; }
    #                        ^     ### Final command needs semicolon.
    
*   Assuming uninitialized variables (variables before a value is assigned to them) are "zeroed out". An uninitialized variable has a value of _null_, _not_ zero.
    
    #!/bin/bash
    
    echo "uninitialized\_var = $uninitialized\_var"
    # uninitialized\_var =
    
    # However . . .
    # if $BASH\_VERSION â¥ 4.2; then
    
    if \[\[ ! -v uninitialized\_var \]\]
    then
      uninitialized\_var=0   # Initialize it to zero!
    fi
    
    
*   Mixing up _\=_ and _\-eq_ in a test. Remember, _\=_ is for comparing literal variables and _\-eq_ for integers.
    
    if \[ "$a" = 273 \]      # Is $a an integer or string?
    if \[ "$a" -eq 273 \]    # If $a is an integer.
    
    # Sometimes you can interchange -eq and = without adverse consequences.
    # However . . .
    
    
    a=273.0   # Not an integer.
    	   
    if \[ "$a" = 273 \]
    then
      echo "Comparison works."
    else  
      echo "Comparison does not work."
    fi    # Comparison does not work.
    
    # Same with   a=" 273"  and a="0273".
    
    
    # Likewise, problems trying to use "-eq" with non-integer values.
    	   
    if \[ "$a" -eq 273.0 \]
    then
      echo "a = $a"
    fi  # Aborts with an error message.  
    # test.sh: \[: 273.0: integer expression expected
    
*   Misusing [string comparison](#SCOMPARISON1) operators.
    
    **Example 34-1. Numerical and string comparison are not equivalent**
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # bad-op.sh: Trying to use a string comparison on integers.
    
    echo
    number=1
    
    #  The following while-loop has two errors:
    #+ one blatant, and the other subtle.
    
    while \[ "$number" < 5 \]    # Wrong! Should be:  while \[ "$number" -lt 5 \]
    do
      echo -n "$number "
      let "number += 1"
    done  
    #  Attempt to run this bombs with the error message:
    #+ bad-op.sh: line 10: 5: No such file or directory
    #  Within single brackets, "<" must be escaped,
    #+ and even then, it's still wrong for comparing integers.
    
    echo "---------------------"
    
    while \[ "$number" \\< 5 \]    #  1 2 3 4
    do                          #
      echo -n "$number "        #  It \*seems\* to work, but . . .
      let "number += 1"         #+ it actually does an ASCII comparison,
    done                        #+ rather than a numerical one.
    
    echo; echo "---------------------"
    
    # This can cause problems. For example:
    
    lesser=5
    greater=105
    
    if \[ "$greater" \\< "$lesser" \]
    then
      echo "$greater is less than $lesser"
    fi                          # 105 is less than 5
    #  In fact, "105" actually is less than "5"
    #+ in a string comparison (ASCII sort order).
    
    echo
    
    exit 0
    
*   Attempting to use [let](#LETREF) to set string variables.
    
    let "a = hello, you"
    echo "$a"   # 0
    
*   Sometimes variables within "test" brackets (\[ \]) need to be quoted (double quotes). Failure to do so may cause unexpected behavior. See [Example 7-6](#STRTEST), [Example 20-5](#REDIR2), and [Example 9-6](#ARGLIST).
    
*   Quoting a variable containing whitespace [prevents splitting](#WSQUO). Sometimes this produces [unintended consequences](#VARSPLITTING).
    
*   Commands issued from a script may fail to execute because the script owner lacks execute permission for them. If a user cannot invoke a command from the command-line, then putting it into a script will likewise fail. Try changing the attributes of the command in question, perhaps even setting the suid bit (as _root_, of course).
    
*   Attempting to use **\-** as a redirection operator (which it is not) will usually result in an unpleasant surprise.
    
    command1 2> - | command2
    # Trying to redirect error output of command1 into a pipe . . .
    # . . . will not work.	
    
    command1 2>& - | command2  # Also futile.
    
    Thanks, S.C.
    
*   Using Bash [version 2+](#BASH2REF) functionality may cause a bailout with error messages. Older Linux machines may have version 1.XX of Bash as the default installation.
    
    #!/bin/bash
    
    minimum\_version=2
    # Since Chet Ramey is constantly adding features to Bash,
    # you may set $minimum\_version to 2.XX, 3.XX, or whatever is appropriate.
    E\_BAD\_VERSION=80
    
    if \[ "$BASH\_VERSION" \\< "$minimum\_version" \]
    then
      echo "This script works only with Bash, version $minimum or greater."
      echo "Upgrade strongly recommended."
      exit $E\_BAD\_VERSION
    fi
    
    ...
    
*   Using Bash-specific functionality in a [Bourne shell](#BASHDEF) script (**#!/bin/sh**) on a non-Linux machine [may cause unexpected behavior](#BINSH). A Linux system usually aliases **sh** to **bash**, but this does not necessarily hold true for a generic UNIX machine.
    
*   Using undocumented features in Bash turns out to be a dangerous practice. In previous releases of this book there were several scripts that depended on the "feature" that, although the maximum value of an [exit](#EXITSTATUSREF) or [return](#RETURNREF) value was 255, that limit did not apply to _negative_ integers. Unfortunately, in version 2.05b and later, that loophole disappeared. See [Example 24-9](#RETURNTEST).
    
*   In certain contexts, a misleading [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) may be returned. This may occur when [setting a local variable within a function](#EXITVALANOMALY01) or when [assigning an arithmetic value to a variable](#EXITVALANOMALY02).
    
*   The [exit status of an arithmetic expression](#ARXS) is _not_ equivalent to an _error code_.
    
    var=1 && ((--var)) && echo $var
    #        ^^^^^^^^^ Here the and-list terminates with exit status 1.
    #                     $var doesn't echo!
    echo $?   # 1
    
*   A script with DOS-type newlines (_\\r\\n_) will fail to execute, since **#!/bin/bash\\r\\n** is _not_ recognized, _not_ the same as the expected **#!/bin/bash\\n**. The fix is to convert the script to UNIX-style newlines.
    
    #!/bin/bash
    
    echo "Here"
    
    unix2dos $0    # Script changes itself to DOS format.
    chmod 755 $0   # Change back to execute permission.
                   # The 'unix2dos' command removes execute permission.
    
    ./$0           # Script tries to run itself again.
                   # But it won't work as a DOS file.
    
    echo "There"
    
    exit 0
    
*   A shell script headed by **#!/bin/sh** will not run in full Bash-compatibility mode. Some Bash-specific functions might be disabled. Scripts that need complete access to all the Bash-specific extensions should start with **#!/bin/bash**.
    
*   [Putting whitespace in front of the terminating limit string](#INDENTEDLS) of a [here document](#HEREDOCREF) will cause unexpected behavior in a script.
    
*   Putting more than one _echo_ statement in a function [whose output is captured](#RVT).
    
    add2 ()
    {
      echo "Whatever ... "   # Delete this line!
      let "retval = $1 + $2"
        echo $retval
        }
    
        num1=12
        num2=43
        echo "Sum of $num1 and $num2 = $(add2 $num1 $num2)"
    
    #   Sum of 12 and 43 = Whatever ... 
    #   55
    
    #        The "echoes" concatenate.
    
    This [will not work](#RVTCAUTION).
    
*   A script may not **export** variables back to its [parent process](#FORKREF), the shell, or to the environment. Just as we learned in biology, a child process can inherit from a parent, but not vice versa.
    
    WHATEVER=/home/bozo
    export WHATEVER
    exit 0
    
    bash$ **echo $WHATEVER**
    bash$ 
    
    Sure enough, back at the command prompt, $WHATEVER remains unset.
    
*   Setting and manipulating variables in a [subshell](#SUBSHELLSREF), then attempting to use those same variables outside the scope of the subshell will result an unpleasant surprise.
    
    **Example 34-2. Subshell Pitfalls**
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # Pitfalls of variables in a subshell.
    
    outer\_variable=outer
    echo
    echo "outer\_variable = $outer\_variable"
    echo
    
    (
    # Begin subshell
    
    echo "outer\_variable inside subshell = $outer\_variable"
    inner\_variable=inner  # Set
    echo "inner\_variable inside subshell = $inner\_variable"
    outer\_variable=inner  # Will value change globally?
    echo "outer\_variable inside subshell = $outer\_variable"
    
    # Will 'exporting' make a difference?
    #    export inner\_variable
    #    export outer\_variable
    # Try it and see.
    
    # End subshell
    )
    
    echo
    echo "inner\_variable outside subshell = $inner\_variable"  # Unset.
    echo "outer\_variable outside subshell = $outer\_variable"  # Unchanged.
    echo
    
    exit 0
    
    # What happens if you uncomment lines 19 and 20?
    # Does it make a difference?
    
*   [Piping](#PIPEREF) **echo** output to a [read](#READREF) may produce unexpected results. In this scenario, the **read** acts as if it were running in a subshell. Instead, use the [set](#SETREF) command (as in [Example 15-18](#SETPOS)).
    
    **Example 34-3. Piping the output of _echo_ to a _read_**
    
    #!/bin/bash
    #  badread.sh:
    #  Attempting to use 'echo and 'read'
    #+ to assign variables non-interactively.
    
    #   shopt -s lastpipe
    
    a=aaa
    b=bbb
    c=ccc
    
    echo "one two three" | read a b c
    # Try to reassign a, b, and c.
    
    echo
    echo "a = $a"  # a = aaa
    echo "b = $b"  # b = bbb
    echo "c = $c"  # c = ccc
    # Reassignment failed.
    
    ### However . . .
    ##  Uncommenting line 6:
    #   shopt -s lastpipe
    ##+ fixes the problem!
    ### This is a new feature in Bash, version 4.2.
    
    # ------------------------------
    
    # Try the following alternative.
    
    var=\`echo "one two three"\`
    set -- $var
    a=$1; b=$2; c=$3
    
    echo "-------"
    echo "a = $a"  # a = one
    echo "b = $b"  # b = two
    echo "c = $c"  # c = three 
    # Reassignment succeeded.
    
    # ------------------------------
    
    #  Note also that an echo to a 'read' works within a subshell.
    #  However, the value of the variable changes \*only\* within the subshell.
    
    a=aaa          # Starting all over again.
    b=bbb
    c=ccc
    
    echo; echo
    echo "one two three" | ( read a b c;
    echo "Inside subshell: "; echo "a = $a"; echo "b = $b"; echo "c = $c" )
    # a = one
    # b = two
    # c = three
    echo "-----------------"
    echo "Outside subshell: "
    echo "a = $a"  # a = aaa
    echo "b = $b"  # b = bbb
    echo "c = $c"  # c = ccc
    echo
    
    exit 0
    
    In fact, as Anthony Richardson points out, piping to _any_ loop can cause a similar problem.

    # ==================And here is another alternative==================
    
    #  Places the part of the script that reads the variables
    #+ within a code block, so they share the same subshell.
    #  Thank you, W.B.
    
    find $HOME -type f -atime +30 -size 100k | {
         foundone=false
         while read f

         fi
    }
    
    A lookalike problem occurs when trying to write the stdout of a **tail -f** piped to [grep](#GREPREF).
    
    tail -f /var/log/messages | grep "$ERROR\_MSG" >> error.log
    #  The "error.log" file will not have anything written to it.
    #  As Samuli Kaipiainen points out, this results from grep
    #+ buffering its output.
    #  The fix is to add the "--line-buffered" parameter to grep.
    
*   Using "suid" commands within scripts is risky, as it may compromise system security. [\[123\]](#FTN.AEN19993)
    
*   Using shell scripts for CGI programming may be problematic. Shell script variables are not "typesafe," and this can cause undesirable behavior as far as CGI is concerned. Moreover, it is difficult to "cracker-proof" shell scripts.
    
*   Bash does not handle the [double slash (//) string](#DOUBLESLASHREF) correctly.
    
*   Bash scripts written for Linux or BSD systems may need fixups to run on a commercial UNIX machine. Such scripts often employ the GNU set of commands and filters, which have greater functionality than their generic UNIX counterparts. This is particularly true of such text processing utilites as [tr](#TRREF).
    
*   Sadly, updates to Bash itself have broken older scripts that [used to work perfectly fine](#PARAGRAPHSPACE). Let us recall [how risky it is to use undocumented Bash features](#UNDOCF).

Chapter 35. Scripting With Style
================================

Get into the habit of writing shell scripts in a structured and systematic manner. Even on-the-fly and "written on the back of an envelope" scripts will benefit if you take a few minutes to plan and organize your thoughts before sitting down and coding.

Herewith are a few stylistic guidelines. This is not (necessarily) intended as an _Official Shell Scripting Stylesheet_.

* * *

35.1. Unofficial Shell Scripting Stylesheet
===========================================

*   Comment your code. This makes it easier for others to understand (and appreciate), and easier for you to maintain.

    #  It made perfect sense when you wrote it last year,
    #+ but now it's a complete mystery.
    #  (From Antek Sawicki's "pw.sh" script.)
    
    Add descriptive headers to your scripts and functions.

36.1. Interactive and non-interactive shells and scripts
========================================================

An _interactive_ shell reads commands from user input on a tty. Among other things, such a shell reads startup files on activation, displays a prompt, and enables job control by default. The user can _interact_ with the shell.

A shell running a script is always a non-interactive shell. All the same, the script can still access its tty. It is even possible to emulate an interactive shell in a script.

#!/bin/bash
MY\_PROMPT='$ '
while :
do
  echo -n "$MY\_PROMPT"
  read line
  eval "$line"
  done

exit 0

# This example script, and much of the above explanation supplied by
# StÃ©phane Chazelas (thanks again).

Let us consider an _interactive_ script to be one that requires input from the user, usually with [read](#READREF) statements (see [Example 15-3](#EX36)). "Real life" is actually a bit messier than that. For now, assume an interactive script is bound to a tty, a script that a user has invoked from the console or an _xterm_.

Init and startup scripts are necessarily non-interactive, since they must run without human intervention. Many administrative and system maintenance scripts are likewise non-interactive. Unvarying repetitive tasks cry out for automation by non-interactive scripts.

Non-interactive scripts can run in the background, but interactive ones hang, waiting for input that never comes. Handle that difficulty by having an **expect** script or embedded [here document](#HEREDOCREF) feed input to an interactive script running as a background job. In the simplest case, redirect a file to supply input to a **read** statement (**read variable <file**). These particular workarounds make possible general purpose scripts that run in either interactive or non-interactive modes.

If a script needs to test whether it is running in an interactive shell, it is simply a matter of finding whether the _prompt_ variable, [$PS1](#PS1REF) is set. (If the user is being prompted for input, then the script needs to display a prompt.)

if \[ -z $PS1 \] # no prompt?
### if \[ -v PS1 \]   # On Bash 4.2+ ...
then
  # non-interactive
  ...
else
  # interactive
  ...
fi

Alternatively, the script can test for the presence of option "i" in the [$-](#FLPREF) flag.

case $- in
\*i\*)    # interactive shell
;;
\*)      # non-interactive shell
;;
# (Courtesy of "UNIX F.A.Q.," 1993)

However, John Lange describes an alternative method, using the [\-t _test_ operator](#TERMTEST).

\# Test for a terminal!

fd=0   # stdin

#  As we recall, the -t test option checks whether the stdin, \[ -t 0 \],
#+ or stdout, \[ -t 1 \], in a given script is running in a terminal.
if \[ -t "$fd" \]
then
  echo interactive
else
  echo non-interactive
fi


#  But, as John points out:
#    if \[ -t 0 \] works ... when you're logged in locally
#    but fails when you invoke the command remotely via ssh.
#    So for a true test you also have to test for a socket.

if \[\[ -t "$fd" || -p /dev/stdin \]\]
then
  echo interactive
else
  echo non-interactive
fi

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Scripts may be forced to run in interactive mode with the \-i option or with a **#!/bin/bash -i** header. Be aware that this can cause erratic script behavior or show error messages even when no error is present.

36.2. Shell Wrappers
====================

A _wrapper_ is a shell script that embeds a system command or utility, that accepts and passes a set of parameters to that command. [\[125\]](#FTN.AEN20130) Wrapping a script around a complex command-line simplifies invoking it. This is expecially useful with [sed](#SEDREF) and [awk](#AWKREF).

A **sed** or **awk** script would normally be invoked from the command-line by a **sed -e _'commands'_** or **awk _'commands'_**. Embedding such a script in a Bash script permits calling it more simply, and makes it _reusable_. This also enables combining the functionality of _sed_ and _awk_, for example [piping](#PIPEREF) the output of a set of _sed_ commands to _awk_. As a saved executable file, you can then repeatedly invoke it in its original form or modified, without the inconvenience of retyping it on the command-line.

**Example 36-1. _shell wrapper_**

#!/bin/bash

# This simple script removes blank lines from a file.
# No argument checking.
#
# You might wish to add something like:
#
# E\_NOARGS=85
# if \[ -z "$1" \]
# then
#  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` target-file"
#  exit $E\_NOARGS
# fi



sed -e /^$/d "$1"
# Same as
#    sed -e '/^$/d' filename
# invoked from the command-line.

#  The '-e' means an "editing" command follows (optional here).
#  '^' indicates the beginning of line, '$' the end.
#  This matches lines with nothing between the beginning and the end --
#+ blank lines.
#  The 'd' is the delete command.

#  Quoting the command-line arg permits
#+ whitespace and special characters in the filename.

#  Note that this script doesn't actually change the target file.
#  If you need to do that, redirect its output.

exit

**Example 36-2. A slightly more complex _shell wrapper_**

#!/bin/bash

#  subst.sh: a script that substitutes one pattern for
#+ another in a file,
#+ i.e., "sh subst.sh Smith Jones letter.txt".
#                     Jones replaces Smith.

ARGS=3         # Script requires 3 arguments.
E\_BADARGS=85   # Wrong number of arguments passed to script.

if \[ $# -ne "$ARGS" \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` old-pattern new-pattern filename"
  exit $E\_BADARGS
fi

old\_pattern=$1
new\_pattern=$2

if \[ -f "$3" \]
then
    file\_name=$3
else
    echo "File \\"$3\\" does not exist."
    exit $E\_BADARGS
fi


# -----------------------------------------------
#  Here is where the heavy work gets done.
sed -e "s/$old\_pattern/$new\_pattern/g" $file\_name
# -----------------------------------------------

#  's' is, of course, the substitute command in sed,
#+ and /pattern/ invokes address matching.
#  The 'g,' or global flag causes substitution for EVERY
#+ occurence of $old\_pattern on each line, not just the first.
#  Read the 'sed' docs for an in-depth explanation.

exit $?  # Redirect the output of this script to write to a file.

**Example 36-3. A generic _shell wrapper_ that writes to a logfile**

#!/bin/bash
#  logging-wrapper.sh
#  Generic shell wrapper that performs an operation
#+ and logs it.

DEFAULT\_LOGFILE=logfile.txt

# Set the following two variables.
OPERATION=
#         Can be a complex chain of commands,
#+        for example an awk script or a pipe . . .

LOGFILE=
if \[ -z "$LOGFILE" \]
then     # If not set, default to ...
  LOGFILE="$DEFAULT\_LOGFILE"
fi

#         Command-line arguments, if any, for the operation.
OPTIONS="$@"


# Log it.
echo "\`date\` + \`whoami\` + $OPERATION "$@"" >> $LOGFILE
# Now, do it.
exec $OPERATION "$@"

# It's necessary to do the logging before the operation.
# Why?

**Example 36-4. A _shell wrapper_ around an awk script**

#!/bin/bash
# pr-ascii.sh: Prints a table of ASCII characters.

START=33   # Range of printable ASCII characters (decimal).
END=127    # Will not work for unprintable characters (> 127).

echo " Decimal   Hex     Character"   # Header.
echo " -------   ---     ---------"

for ((i=START; i<=END; i++))
do
  echo $i | awk '{printf("  %3d       %2x         %c\\n", $1, $1, $1)}'
# The Bash printf builtin will not work in this context:
#     printf "%c" "$i"
done

exit 0


#  Decimal   Hex     Character
#  -------   ---     ---------
#    33       21         !
#    34       22         "
#    35       23         #
#    36       24         $
#
#    . . .
#
#   122       7a         z
#   123       7b         {
#   124       7c         |
#   125       7d         }


#  Redirect the output of this script to a file
#+ or pipe it to "more":  sh pr-asc.sh | more

**Example 36-5. A _shell wrapper_ around another awk script**

#!/bin/bash

# Adds up a specified column (of numbers) in the target file.
# Floating-point (decimal) numbers okay, because awk can handle them.

ARGS=2
E\_WRONGARGS=85

if \[ $# -ne "$ARGS" \] # Check for proper number of command-line args.
then
   echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` filename column-number"
   exit $E\_WRONGARGS
fi

filename=$1
column\_number=$2

#  Passing shell variables to the awk part of the script is a bit tricky.
#  One method is to strong-quote the Bash-script variable
#+ within the awk script.
#     $'$BASH\_SCRIPT\_VAR'
#      ^                ^
#  This is done in the embedded awk script below.
#  See the awk documentation for more details.

# A multi-line awk script is here invoked by
#   awk '
#   ...
#   ...
#   ...
#   '


# Begin awk script.
# -----------------------------
awk '

{ total += $'"${column\_number}"'
}
END {
     print total
}     

' "$filename"
# -----------------------------
# End awk script.


#   It may not be safe to pass shell variables to an embedded awk script,
#+  so Stephane Chazelas proposes the following alternative:
#   ---------------------------------------
#   awk -v column\_number="$column\_number" '
#   { total += $column\_number
#   }
#   END {
#       print total
#   }' "$filename"
#   ---------------------------------------


exit 0

For those scripts needing a single do-it-all tool, a Swiss army knife, there is _Perl_. Perl combines the capabilities of [sed](#SEDREF) and [awk](#AWKREF), and throws in a large subset of **C**, to boot. It is modular and contains support for everything ranging from object-oriented programming up to and including the kitchen sink. Short Perl scripts lend themselves to embedding within shell scripts, and there may be some substance to the claim that Perl can totally replace shell scripting (though the author of the _ABS Guide_ remains skeptical).

**Example 36-6. Perl embedded in a _Bash_ script**

#!/bin/bash

# Shell commands may precede the Perl script.
echo "This precedes the embedded Perl script within \\"$0\\"."
echo "==============================================================="

perl -e 'print "This line prints from an embedded Perl script.\\n";'
# Like sed, Perl also uses the "-e" option.

echo "==============================================================="
echo "However, the script may also contain shell and system commands."

exit 0

It is even possible to combine a Bash script and Perl script within the same file. Depending on how the script is invoked, either the Bash part or the Perl part will execute.

**Example 36-7. Bash and Perl scripts combined**

#!/bin/bash
# bashandperl.sh

echo "Greetings from the Bash part of the script, $0."
# More Bash commands may follow here.

exit
# End of Bash part of the script.

# =======================================================

#!/usr/bin/perl
# This part of the script must be invoked with
#    perl -x bashandperl.sh

print "Greetings from the Perl part of the script, $0.\\n";
#      Perl doesn't seem to like "echo" ...
# More Perl commands may follow here.

# End of Perl part of the script.

bash$ **bash bashandperl.sh**
Greetings from the Bash part of the script.

bash$ **perl -x bashandperl.sh**
Greetings from the Perl part of the script.
	      

It is, of course, possible to embed even more exotic scripting languages within shell wrappers. _Python_, for example ...

**Example 36-8. Python embedded in a _Bash_ script**

#!/bin/bash
# ex56py.sh

# Shell commands may precede the Python script.
echo "This precedes the embedded Python script within \\"$0.\\""
echo "==============================================================="

python -c 'print "This line prints from an embedded Python script.\\n";'
# Unlike sed and perl, Python uses the "-c" option.
python -c 'k = raw\_input( "Hit a key to exit to outer script. " )'

echo "==============================================================="
echo "However, the script may also contain shell and system commands."

exit 0

Wrapping a script around _mplayer_ and the Google's translation server, you can create something that talks back to you.

**Example 36-9. A script that speaks**

#!/bin/bash
#   Courtesy of:
#   http://elinux.org/RPi\_Text\_to\_Speech\_(Speech\_Synthesis)

#  You must be on-line for this script to work,
#+ so you can access the Google translation server.
#  Of course, mplayer must be present on your computer.

speak()
  {
  local IFS=+
  # Invoke mplayer, then connect to Google translation server.
  /usr/bin/mplayer -ao alsa -really-quiet -noconsolecontrols \\
 "http://translate.google.com/translate\_tts?tl=en&q="$\*""
  # Google translates, but can also speak.
  }

LINES=4

spk=$(tail -$LINES $0) # Tail end of same script!
speak "$spk"
exit
# Browns. Nice talking to you.

One interesting example of a complex shell wrapper is Martin Matusiak's [_undvd_ script](http://sourceforge.net/projects/undvd/), which provides an easy-to-use command-line interface to the complex [mencoder](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/mencoder.html) utility. Another example is Itzchak Rehberg's [Ext3Undel](http://projects.izzysoft.de/trac/ext3undel), a set of scripts to recover deleted file on an _ext3_ filesystem.

36.3. Tests and Comparisons: Alternatives
=========================================

For tests, the [\[\[ \]\]](#DBLBRACKETS) construct may be more appropriate than **\[ \]**. Likewise, [arithmetic comparisons](#ICOMPARISON1) might benefit from the [(( ))](#DBLPARENS) construct.

a=8

# All of the comparisons below are equivalent.
test "$a" -lt 16 && echo "yes, $a < 16"         # "and list"
/bin/test "$a" -lt 16 && echo "yes, $a < 16" 
\[ "$a" -lt 16 \] && echo "yes, $a < 16" 
\[\[ $a -lt 16 \]\] && echo "yes, $a < 16"          # Quoting variables within
(( a < 16 )) && echo "yes, $a < 16"             # \[\[ \]\] and (( )) not necessary.

city="New York"
# Again, all of the comparisons below are equivalent.
test "$city" \\< Paris && echo "Yes, Paris is greater than $city"
                                  # Greater ASCII order.
/bin/test "$city" \\< Paris && echo "Yes, Paris is greater than $city" 
\[ "$city" \\< Paris \] && echo "Yes, Paris is greater than $city" 
\[\[ $city < Paris \]\] && echo "Yes, Paris is greater than $city"
                                  # Need not quote $city.

# Thank you, S.C.

* * *

36.4. Recursion: a script calling itself
========================================

Can a script [recursively](#RECURSIONREF) call itself? Indeed.

**Example 36-10. A (useless) script that recursively calls itself**

#!/bin/bash
# recurse.sh

#  Can a script recursively call itself?
#  Yes, but is this of any practical use?
#  (See the following.)

RANGE=10
MAXVAL=9

i=$RANDOM
let "i %= $RANGE"  # Generate a random number between 0 and $RANGE - 1.

if \[ "$i" -lt "$MAXVAL" \]
then
  echo "i = $i"
  ./$0             #  Script recursively spawns a new instance of itself.
fi                 #  Each child script does the same, until
                   #+ a generated $i equals $MAXVAL.

#  Using a "while" loop instead of an "if/then" test causes problems.
#  Explain why.

exit 0

# Note:
# ----
# This script must have execute permission for it to work properly.
# This is the case even if it is invoked by an "sh" command.
# Explain why.

**Example 36-11. A (useful) script that recursively calls itself**

#!/bin/bash
# pb.sh: phone book

# Written by Rick Boivie, and used with permission.
# Modifications by ABS Guide author.

MINARGS=1     #  Script needs at least one argument.
DATAFILE=./phonebook
              #  A data file in current working directory
              #+ named "phonebook" must exist.
PROGNAME=$0
E\_NOARGS=70   #  No arguments error.

if \[ $# -lt $MINARGS \]; then
      echo "Usage: "$PROGNAME" data-to-look-up"
      exit $E\_NOARGS
fi      


if \[ $# -eq $MINARGS \]; then
      grep $1 "$DATAFILE"
      # 'grep' prints an error message if $DATAFILE not present.
else
      ( shift; "$PROGNAME" $\* ) | grep $1
      # Script recursively calls itself.
fi

exit 0        #  Script exits here.
              #  Therefore, it's o.k. to put
              #+ non-hashmarked comments and data after this point.

#  A user with the proper permissions only has to type

#   usermount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy

# Additional notes (from the author of this script): 
# -------------------------------------------------

# 1) Linux allows the "users" option in the /etc/fstab
#    file so that any user can mount removable media.
#    But, on a server, I like to allow only a few
#    individuals access to removable media.
#    I find using sudo gives me more control.

# 2) I also find sudo to be more convenient than
#    accomplishing this task through groups.

# 3) This method gives anyone with proper permissions
#    root access to the mount command, so be careful
#    about who you allow access.
#    You can get finer control over which access can be mounted
#    by using this same technique in separate mntfloppy, mntcdrom,
#    and mntsamba scripts.

Too many levels of recursion can exhaust the script's stack space, causing a segfault.

36.5. "Colorizing" Scripts
==========================

The ANSI [\[126\]](#FTN.AEN20259) escape sequences set screen attributes, such as bold text, and color of foreground and background. [DOS batch files](#DOSBATCH1) commonly used ANSI escape codes for _color_ output, and so can Bash scripts.

**Example 36-13. A "colorized" address database**

#!/bin/bash

**Example 36-14. Drawing a box**

#!/bin/bash
# Draw-box.sh: Drawing a box using ASCII characters.

######################################################################
###  draw\_box function doc  ###

#  The "draw\_box" function lets the user
#+ draw a box in a terminal.       
#
#  Usage: draw\_box ROW COLUMN HEIGHT WIDTH \[COLOR\] 
#  ROW and COLUMN represent the position        
#+ of the upper left angle of the box you're going to draw.
#  ROW and COLUMN must be greater than 0
#+ and less than current terminal dimension.
#  HEIGHT is the number of rows of the box, and must be > 0. 
#  HEIGHT + ROW must be <= than current terminal height. 
#  WIDTH is the number of columns of the box and must be > 0.
#  WIDTH + COLUMN must be <= than current terminal width.
#
# E.g.: If your terminal dimension is 20x80,
#  draw\_box 2 3 10 45 is good
#  draw\_box 2 3 19 45 has bad HEIGHT value (19+2 > 20)
#  draw\_box 2 3 18 78 has bad WIDTH value (78+3 > 80)
#
#  COLOR is the color of the box frame.
#  This is the 5th argument and is optional.
#  0=black 1=red 2=green 3=tan 4=blue 5=purple 6=cyan 7=white.
#  If you pass the function bad arguments,
#+ it will just exit with code 65,
#+ and no messages will be printed on stderr.
#
#  Clear the terminal before you start to draw a box.
#  The clear command is not contained within the function.
#  This allows the user to draw multiple boxes, even overlapping ones.

# Exercise:

The simplest, and perhaps most useful ANSI escape sequence is bold text, **\\033\[1m ... \\033\[0m**. The \\033 represents an [escape](#ESCP), the "\[1" turns on the bold attribute, while the "\[0" switches it off. The "m" terminates each term of the escape sequence.

bash$ **echo -e "\\033\[1mThis is bold text.\\033\[0m"**
	      

A similar escape sequence switches on the underline attribute (on an _rxvt_ and an _aterm_).

bash$ **echo -e "\\033\[4mThis is underlined text.\\033\[0m"**
	      

![Note](../images/note.gif)

With an **echo**, the \-e option enables the escape sequences.

Other escape sequences change the text and/or background color.

bash$ **echo -e '\\E\[34;47mThis prints in blue.'; tput sgr0**

bash$ **echo -e '\\E\[33;44m'"yellow text on blue background"; tput sgr0**

bash$ **echo -e '\\E\[1;33;44m'"BOLD yellow text on blue background"; tput sgr0**
	      

![Note](../images/note.gif)

It's usually advisable to set the _bold_ attribute for light-colored foreground text.

The **tput sgr0** restores the terminal settings to normal. Omitting this lets all subsequent output from that particular terminal remain blue.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Since **tput sgr0** fails to restore terminal settings under certain circumstances, **echo -ne \\E\[0m** may be a better choice.

Use the following template for writing colored text on a colored background.

**echo -e '\\E\[COLOR1;COLOR2mSome text goes here.'**

The "\\E\[" begins the escape sequence. The semicolon-separated numbers "COLOR1" and "COLOR2" specify a foreground and a background color, according to the table below. (The order of the numbers does not matter, since the foreground and background numbers fall in non-overlapping ranges.) The "m" terminates the escape sequence, and the text begins immediately after that.

Note also that [single quotes](#SNGLQUO) enclose the remainder of the command sequence following the **echo -e**.

The numbers in the following table work for an _rxvt_ terminal. Results may vary for other terminal emulators.

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

There is, however, a major problem with all this. _ANSI escape sequences are emphatically [non-portable](#PORTABILITYISSUES)._ What works fine on some terminal emulators (or the console) may work differently, or not at all, on others. A "colorized" script that looks stunning on the script author's machine may produce unreadable output on someone else's. This somewhat compromises the usefulness of colorizing scripts, and possibly relegates this technique to the status of a gimmick. Colorized scripts are probably inappropriate in a commercial setting, i.e., your supervisor might disapprove.

Alister's [ansi-color](http://code.google.com/p/ansi-color/) utility (based on [Moshe Jacobson's color utility](http://bash.deta.in/color-1.1.tar.gz) considerably simplifies using ANSI escape sequences. It substitutes a clean and logical syntax for the clumsy constructs just discussed.

Henry/teikedvl has likewise created a utility ([http://scriptechocolor.sourceforge.net/](http://scriptechocolor.sourceforge.net/)) to simplify creation of colorized scripts.

36.6. Optimizations
===================

Most shell scripts are quick 'n dirty solutions to non-complex problems. As such, optimizing them for speed is not much of an issue. Consider the case, though, where a script carries out an important task, does it well, but runs too slowly. Rewriting it in a compiled language may not be a palatable option. The simplest fix would be to rewrite the parts of the script that slow it down. Is it possible to apply principles of code optimization even to a lowly shell script?

Check the loops in the script. Time consumed by repetitive operations adds up quickly. If at all possible, remove time-consuming operations from within loops.

Use [builtin](#BUILTINREF) commands in preference to system commands. Builtins execute faster and usually do not launch a subshell when invoked.

Avoid unnecessary commands, particularly in a [pipe](#PIPEREF).

cat "$file" | grep "$word"

grep "$word" "$file"

#  The above command-lines have an identical effect,
#+ but the second runs faster since it launches one fewer subprocess.

The [cat](#CATREF) command seems especially prone to overuse in scripts.

Disabling certain Bash options can speed up scripts.

As Erik Brandsberg points out:

If you don't need [Unicode](#UNICODEREF) support, you can get potentially a 2x or more improvement in speed by simply setting the **LC\_ALL** variable.

   export LC\_ALL=C

   \[specifies the locale as ANSI C,
   thereby disabling Unicode support\]

\[In an example script ...\]

Without \[Unicode support\]:
erik@erik-desktop:~/capture$ time ./cap-ngrep.sh
live2.pcap > out.txt

  real        0m20.483s
  user        1m34.470s
  sys         0m12.869s

With \[Unicode support\]:
erik@erik-desktop:~/capture$ time ./cap-ngrep.sh
live2.pcap > out.txt

  real        0m50.232s
  user        3m51.118s
  sys         0m11.221s

A large part of the overhead that is optimized is, I believe,
regex match using \[\[ string =~ REGEX \]\],
but it may help with other portions of the code as well.
I hadn't \[seen it\] mentioned that this optimization helped
with Bash, but I had seen it helped with "grep,"
so why not try?

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Certain operators, notably [expr](#EXPRREF), are very inefficient and might be replaced by [double parentheses](#DBLPARENS) arithmetic expansion. See [Example A-59](#TESTEXECTIME).

Math tests

math via $(( ))

real          0m0.364s
user          0m0.372s
sys           0m0.000s

[Condition testing](#IFTHEN) constructs in scripts deserve close scrutiny. Substitute [case](#CASEESAC1) for [if-then](#IFTHEN) constructs and combine tests when possible, to minimize script execution time. Again, refer to [Example A-59](#TESTEXECTIME).

Test using "case" construct:
real          0m0.329s
user          0m0.320s
sys           0m0.000s


Test with if \[\], no quotes:
real          0m0.438s
user          0m0.432s
sys           0m0.008s


Test with if \[\], quotes:
real          0m0.476s
user          0m0.452s
sys           0m0.024s


Test with if \[\], using -eq:
real          0m0.457s
user          0m0.456s
sys           0m0.000s

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Erik Brandsberg recommends using [associative arrays](#ASSOCARR) in preference to conventional numeric-indexed arrays in most cases. When overwriting values in a numeric array, there is a significant performance penalty vs. associative arrays. Running a test script confirms this. See [Example A-60](#ASSOCARRTEST).

Use the [time](#TIMREF) and [times](#TIMESREF) tools to profile computation-intensive commands. Consider rewriting time-critical code sections in C, or even in assembler.

Try to minimize file I/O. Bash is not particularly efficient at handling files, so consider using more appropriate tools for this within the script, such as [awk](#AWKREF) or [Perl](#PERLREF).

Write your scripts in a modular and coherent form, [\[127\]](#FTN.AEN20452) so they can be reorganized and tightened up as necessary. Some of the optimization techniques applicable to high-level languages may work for scripts, but others, such as _loop unrolling_, are mostly irrelevant. Above all, use common sense.

For an excellent demonstration of how optimization can dramatically reduce the execution time of a script, see [Example 16-47](#MONTHLYPMT).

36.7. Assorted Tips
===================

36.7.1. Ideas for more powerful scripts
---------------------------------------

*   You have a problem that you want to solve by writing a Bash script. Unfortunately, you don't know quite where to start. One method is to plunge right in and code those parts of the script that come easily, and write the hard parts as _pseudo-code_.
    
    #!/bin/bash
    
    ARGCOUNT=1                     # Need name as argument.
    E\_WRONGARGS=65
    
    if \[ number-of-arguments is-not-equal-to "$ARGCOUNT" \]
    #    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    #  Can't figure out how to code this . . .
    #+ . . . so write it in pseudo-code.
    
    then
      echo "Usage: name-of-script name"
      #            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     More pseudo-code.
      exit $E\_WRONGARGS
    fi 
    
    . . .
    
    exit 0
    
    
    # Later on, substitute working code for the pseudo-code.
    
    # Line 6 becomes:
    if \[ $# -ne "$ARGCOUNT" \]
    
    # Line 12 becomes:
      echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` name"
    
    For an example of using pseudo-code, see the [Square Root](#NEWTONSQRT) exercise.
    
*   To keep a record of which user scripts have run during a particular session or over a number of sessions, add the following lines to each script you want to keep track of. This will keep a continuing file record of the script names and invocation times.
    
    \# Append (>>) following to end of each script tracked.
    
    whoami>> $SAVE\_FILE    # User invoking the script.
    echo $0>> $SAVE\_FILE   # Script name.
    date>> $SAVE\_FILE      # Date and time.
    echo>> $SAVE\_FILE      # Blank line as separator.
    
    #  Of course, SAVE\_FILE defined and exported as environmental variable in ~/.bashrc
    #+ (something like ~/.scripts-run)
    
*   The \>> operator _appends_ lines to a file. What if you wish to _prepend_ a line to an existing file, that is, to paste it in at the beginning?
    
    file=data.txt
    title="\*\*\*This is the title line of data text file\*\*\*"
    
    echo $title | cat - $file >$file.new
    # "cat -" concatenates stdout to $file.
    #  End result is
    #+ to write a new file with $title appended at \*beginning\*.
    
    This is a simplified variant of the [Example 19-13](#PREPENDEX) script given earlier. And, of course, [sed](#SEDREF) can also do this.
    
*   A shell script may act as an embedded command inside another shell script, a _Tcl_ or _wish_ script, or even a [Makefile](#MAKEFILEREF). It can be invoked as an external shell command in a C program using the _system()_ call, i.e., _system("script\_name");_.
    
*   Setting a variable to the contents of an embedded _sed_ or _awk_ script increases the readability of the surrounding [shell wrapper](#SHWRAPPER). See [Example A-1](#MAILFORMAT) and [Example 15-20](#COLTOTALER3).
    
*   Put together files containing your favorite and most useful definitions and functions. As necessary, "include" one or more of these "library files" in scripts with either the [dot](#DOTREF) (**.**) or [source](#SOURCEREF) command.

*   A particularly clever use of [if-test](#TESTCONSTRUCTS1) constructs is for comment blocks.

    #+ for an unpleasant surprise.

    echo "This will not echo."
    
    Comment blocks are error-free! Whee!
    
    fi
    
    echo "No more comments, please."
    
    exit 0
    
    Compare this with [using here documents to comment out code blocks](#CBLOCK1).
    
*   Using the [$? exit status variable](#XSTATVARREF), a script may test if a parameter contains only digits, so it can be treated as an integer.
    
    #!/bin/bash
    
    SUCCESS=0
    E\_BADINPUT=85
    
    test "$1" -ne 0 -o "$1" -eq 0 2>/dev/null
    # An integer is either equal to 0 or not equal to 0.
    # 2>/dev/null suppresses error message.
    
    if \[ $? -ne "$SUCCESS" \]
    then
      echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` integer-input"
      exit $E\_BADINPUT
    fi
    
    let "sum = $1 + 25"             # Would give error if $1 not integer.
    echo "Sum = $sum"
    
    # Any variable, not just a command-line parameter, can be tested this way.
    
    exit 0
    
*   The 0 - 255 range for function return values is a severe limitation. Global variables and other workarounds are often problematic. An alternative method for a function to communicate a value back to the main body of the script is to have the function write to stdout (usually with [echo](#ECHOREF)) the "return value," and assign this to a variable. This is actually a variant of [command substitution.](#COMMANDSUBREF)
    
    **Example 36-18. Return value trickery**
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # multiplication.sh
    
    multiply ()                     # Multiplies params passed.
    {                               # Will accept a variable number of args.
    
      local product=1
    
      until \[ -z "$1" \]             # Until uses up arguments passed...
      do
        let "product \*= $1"
        shift
      done
    
      echo $product                 #  Will not echo to stdout,
    }                               #+ since this will be assigned to a variable.
    
    mult1=15383; mult2=25211
    val1=\`multiply $mult1 $mult2\`
    # Assigns stdout (echo) of function to the variable val1.
    echo "$mult1 X $mult2 = $val1"                   # 387820813
    
    mult1=25; mult2=5; mult3=20
    val2=\`multiply $mult1 $mult2 $mult3\`
    echo "$mult1 X $mult2 X $mult3 = $val2"          # 2500
    
    mult1=188; mult2=37; mult3=25; mult4=47
    val3=\`multiply $mult1 $mult2 $mult3 $mult4\`
    echo "$mult1 X $mult2 X $mult3 X $mult4 = $val3" # 8173300
    
    exit 0
    
    The same technique also works for alphanumeric strings. This means that a function can "return" a non-numeric value.
    
    capitalize\_ichar ()          #  Capitalizes initial character
    {                            #+ of argument string(s) passed.
    
      string0="$@"               # Accepts multiple arguments.
    
      firstchar=${string0:0:1}   # First character.
      string1=${string0:1}       # Rest of string(s).
    
      FirstChar=\`echo "$firstchar" | tr a-z A-Z\`
                                 # Capitalize first character.
    
      echo "$FirstChar$string1"  # Output to stdout.
    
    }  
    
    newstring=\`capitalize\_ichar "every sentence should start with a capital letter."\`
    echo "$newstring"          # Every sentence should start with a capital letter.
    
    It is even possible for a function to "return" multiple values with this method.
    
    **Example 36-19. Even more return value trickery**
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # sum-product.sh
    # A function may "return" more than one value.
    
    sum\_and\_product ()   # Calculates both sum and product of passed args.
    {
      echo $(( $1 + $2 )) $(( $1 \* $2 ))
    # Echoes to stdout each calculated value, separated by space.
    }
    
    echo
    echo "Enter first number "
    read first
    
    echo
    echo "Enter second number "
    read second
    echo
    
    retval=\`sum\_and\_product $first $second\`      # Assigns output of function.
    sum=\`echo "$retval" | awk '{print $1}'\`      # Assigns first field.
    product=\`echo "$retval" | awk '{print $2}'\`  # Assigns second field.
    
    echo "$first + $second = $sum"
    echo "$first \* $second = $product"
    echo
    
    exit 0
    
    ![Caution](../images/caution.gif)
    
    There can be only **one** _echo_ statement in the function for this to work. If you alter the previous example:
    
    sum\_and\_product ()
    {
      echo "This is the sum\_and\_product function." # This messes things up!
      echo $(( $1 + $2 )) $(( $1 \* $2 ))
    }
    ...
    retval=\`sum\_and\_product $first $second\`      # Assigns output of function.
    # Now, this will not work correctly.
    
*   Next in our bag of tricks are techniques for passing an [array](#ARRAYREF) to a [function](#FUNCTIONREF), then "returning" an array back to the main body of the script.
    
    Passing an array involves loading the space-separated elements of the array into a variable with [command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF). Getting an array back as the "return value" from a function uses the previously mentioned strategem of [echoing](#ECHOREF) the array in the function, then invoking command substitution and the **( ... )** operator to assign it to an array.
    
    **Example 36-20. Passing and returning arrays**
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # array-function.sh: Passing an array to a function and ...
    #                   "returning" an array from a function
    
    
    Pass\_Array ()
    {
      local passed\_array   # Local variable!
      passed\_array=( \`echo "$1"\` )
      echo "${passed\_array\[@\]}"
      #  List all the elements of the new array
      #+ declared and set within the function.
    }
    
    
    original\_array=( element1 element2 element3 element4 element5 )
    
    echo
    echo "original\_array = ${original\_array\[@\]}"
    #                      List all elements of original array.
    
    
    # This is the trick that permits passing an array to a function.
    # \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
    argument=\`echo ${original\_array\[@\]}\`
    # \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
    #  Pack a variable
    #+ with all the space-separated elements of the original array.
    #
    # Attempting to just pass the array itself will not work.
    
    
    # This is the trick that allows grabbing an array as a "return value".
    # \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
    returned\_array=( \`Pass\_Array "$argument"\` )
    # \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
    # Assign 'echoed' output of function to array variable.
    
    echo "returned\_array = ${returned\_array\[@\]}"
    
    echo "============================================================="
    
    #  Now, try it again,
    #+ attempting to access (list) the array from outside the function.
    Pass\_Array "$argument"
    
    # The function itself lists the array, but ...
    #+ accessing the array from outside the function is forbidden.
    echo "Passed array (within function) = ${passed\_array\[@\]}"
    # NULL VALUE since the array is a variable local to the function.
    
    echo
    
    ############################################
    
    # And here is an even more explicit example:
    
    ret\_array ()
    {
      for element in {11..20}
      do
        echo "$element "   #  Echo individual elements
      done                 #+ of what will be assembled into an array.
    }
    
    arr=( $(ret\_array) )   #  Assemble into array.
    
    echo "Capturing array \\"arr\\" from function ret\_array () ..."
    echo "Third element of array \\"arr\\" is ${arr\[2\]}."   # 13  (zero-indexed)
    echo -n "Entire array is: "
    echo ${arr\[@\]}                # 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
    
    echo
    
    exit 0
    
    #  Nathan Coulter points out that passing arrays with elements containing
    #+ whitespace breaks this example.
    
    For a more elaborate example of passing arrays to functions, see [Example A-10](#LIFESLOW).
    
*   Using the [double-parentheses construct](#DBLPARENS), it is possible to use C-style syntax for setting and incrementing/decrementing variables and in [for](#FORLOOPREF1) and [while](#WHILELOOPREF) loops. See [Example 11-13](#FORLOOPC) and [Example 11-18](#WHLOOPC).
    
*   Setting the [path](#PATHREF) and [umask](#UMASKREF) at the beginning of a script makes it more [portable](#PORTABILITYISSUES) -- more likely to run on a "foreign" machine whose user may have bollixed up the $PATH and **umask**.
    
    #!/bin/bash
    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin ; export PATH
    umask 022   # Files that the script creates will have 755 permission.
    
    # Thanks to Ian D. Allen, for this tip.
    
*   A useful scripting technique is to _repeatedly_ feed the output of a filter (by piping) back to the _same filter_, but with a different set of arguments and/or options. Especially suitable for this are [tr](#TRREF) and [grep](#GREPREF).
    
    \# From "wstrings.sh" example.
    
    wlist=\`strings "$1" | tr A-Z a-z | tr '\[:space:\]' Z | \\
    tr -cs '\[:alpha:\]' Z | tr -s '\\173-\\377' Z | tr Z ' '\`

*   Running a script on a machine that relies on a command that might not be installed is dangerous. Use [whatis](#WHATISREF) to avoid potential problems with this.
    
    CMD=command1                 # First choice.
    PlanB=command2               # Fallback option.
    
    command\_test=$(whatis "$CMD" | grep 'nothing appropriate')
    #  If 'command1' not found on system , 'whatis' will return
    #+ "command1: nothing appropriate."
    #
    #  A safer alternative is:
    #     command\_test=$(whereis "$CMD" | grep \\/)
    #  But then the sense of the following test would have to be reversed,
    #+ since the $command\_test variable holds content only if
    #+ the $CMD exists on the system.
    #     (Thanks, bojster.)

*   An [if-grep test](#IFGREPREF) may not return expected results in an error case, when text is output to stderr, rather that stdout.
    
    if ls -l nonexistent\_filename | grep -q 'No such file or directory'
      then echo "File \\"nonexistent\_filename\\" does not exist."
    fi
    
    [Redirecting](#IOREDIRREF) stderr to stdout fixes this.

    TMPFILE=tmpfile                  # Create a temp file to store the variable.
    
    (   # Inside the subshell ...
    inner\_variable=Inner
    echo $inner\_variable
    echo $inner\_variable >>$TMPFILE  # Append to temp file.
    )
    
        # Outside the subshell ...
    
    echo; echo "-----"; echo
    echo $inner\_variable             # Null, as expected.
    echo "-----"; echo
    
    # Now ...
    read inner\_variable <$TMPFILE    # Read back shell variable.
    rm -f "$TMPFILE"                 # Get rid of temp file.
    echo "$inner\_variable"           # It's an ugly kludge, but it works.
    
*   The [run-parts](#RUNPARTSREF) command is handy for running a set of command scripts in a particular sequence, especially in combination with [cron](#CRONREF) or [at](#ATREF).
    
*   For doing multiple revisions on a complex script, use the _rcs_ Revision Control System package.
    
    Among other benefits of this is automatically updated ID header tags. The **co** command in _rcs_ does a parameter replacement of certain reserved key words, for example, replacing _\# $Id$_ in a script with something like:
    
    \# $Id: hello-world.sh,v 1.1 2004/10/16 02:43:05 bozo Exp $

36.7.2. Widgets
---------------

It would be nice to be able to invoke X-Windows widgets from a shell script. There happen to exist several packages that purport to do so, namely _Xscript_, _Xmenu_, and _widtools_. The first two of these no longer seem to be maintained. Fortunately, it is still possible to obtain _widtools_ [here](http://www.batse.msfc.nasa.gov/~mallozzi/home/software/xforms/src/widtools-2.0.tgz).

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

The _widtools_ (widget tools) package requires the _XForms_ library to be installed. Additionally, the [Makefile](#MAKEFILEREF) needs some judicious editing before the package will build on a typical Linux system. Finally, three of the six widgets offered do not work (and, in fact, segfault).

The _dialog_ family of tools offers a method of calling "dialog" widgets from a shell script. The original _dialog_ utility works in a text console, but its successors, _gdialog_, _Xdialog_, and _kdialog_ use X-Windows-based widget sets.

**Example 36-22. Widgets invoked from a shell script**

#!/bin/bash
# dialog.sh: Using 'gdialog' widgets.

# Must have 'gdialog' installed on your system to run this script.
# Or, you can replace all instance of 'gdialog' below with 'kdialog' ...
# Version 1.1 (corrected 04/05/05)

# This script was inspired by the following article.
#     "Scripting for X Productivity," by Marco Fioretti,
#      LINUX JOURNAL, Issue 113, September 2003, pp. 86-9.
# Thank you, all you good people at LJ.


# Input error in dialog box.
E\_INPUT=85
# Dimensions of display, input widgets.
HEIGHT=50
WIDTH=60

# Output file name (constructed out of script name).
OUTFILE=$0.output

# Display this script in a text widget.
gdialog --title "Displaying: $0" --textbox $0 $HEIGHT $WIDTH



# Now, we'll try saving input in a file.
echo -n "VARIABLE=" > $OUTFILE
gdialog --title "User Input" --inputbox "Enter variable, please:" \\
$HEIGHT $WIDTH 2>> $OUTFILE


if \[ "$?" -eq 0 \]
# It's good practice to check exit status.
then
  echo "Executed \\"dialog box\\" without errors."
else
  echo "Error(s) in \\"dialog box\\" execution."
        # Or, clicked on "Cancel", instead of "OK" button.
  rm $OUTFILE
  exit $E\_INPUT
fi



# Now, we'll retrieve and display the saved variable.
. $OUTFILE   # 'Source' the saved file.
echo "The variable input in the \\"input box\\" was: "$VARIABLE""


rm $OUTFILE  # Clean up by removing the temp file.
             # Some applications may need to retain this file.

exit $?

# Exercise: Rewrite this script using the 'zenity' widget set.

The [xmessage](#XMESSAGEREF) command is a simple method of popping up a message/query window. For example:

xmessage Fatal error in script! -button exit

The latest entry in the widget sweepstakes is [zenity](#ZENITYREF). This utility pops up _GTK+_ dialog widgets-and-windows, and it works very nicely within a script.

get\_info ()
{
  zenity --entry       #  Pops up query window . . .
                       #+ and prints user entry to stdout.

                       #  Also try the --calendar and --scale options.
}

answer=$( get\_info )   #  Capture stdout in $answer variable.

echo "User entered: "$answer""

For other methods of scripting with widgets, try _Tk_ or _wish_ (_Tcl_ derivatives), _PerlTk_ (_Perl_ with _Tk_ extensions), _tksh_ (_ksh_ with _Tk_ extensions), _XForms4Perl_ (_Perl_ with _XForms_ extensions), _Gtk-Perl_ (_Perl_ with _Gtk_ extensions), or _PyQt_ (_Python_ with _Qt_ extensions).

36.8. Security Issues
=====================

36.8.1. Infected Shell Scripts
------------------------------

A brief warning about script security is indicated. A shell script may contain a _worm_, _trojan_, or even a _virus_. For that reason, never run as _root_ a script (or permit it to be inserted into the system startup scripts in /etc/rc.d) unless you have obtained said script from a trusted source or you have carefully analyzed it to make certain it does nothing harmful.

Various researchers at Bell Labs and other sites, including M. Douglas McIlroy, Tom Duff, and Fred Cohen have investigated the implications of shell script viruses. They conclude that it is all too easy for even a novice, a "script kiddie," to write one. [\[128\]](#FTN.AEN20748)

Here is yet another reason to learn scripting. Being able to look at and understand scripts may protect your system from being compromised by a rogue script.

* * *

36.8.2. Hiding Shell Script Source
----------------------------------

For security purposes, it may be necessary to render a script unreadable. If only there were a utility to create a stripped binary executable from a script. Francisco Rosales' [shc -- generic shell script compiler](http://www.datsi.fi.upm.es/~frosal/sources/) does exactly that.

Unfortunately, according to [an article](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8256) in the October, 2005 _Linux Journal_, the binary can, in at least some cases, be decrypted to recover the original script source. Still, this could be a useful method of keeping scripts secure from all but the most skilled hackers.

* * *

36.8.3. Writing Secure Shell Scripts
------------------------------------

_Dan Stromberg_ suggests the following guidelines for writing (relatively) secure shell scripts.

*   Don't put secret data in [environment variables](#ENVREF).
    
*   Don't pass secret data in an external command's arguments (pass them in via a [pipe](#PIPEREF) or [redirection](#IOREDIRREF) instead).
    
*   Set your [$PATH](#PATHREF) carefully. Don't just trust whatever path you inherit from the caller if your script is running as _root_. In fact, whenever you use an environment variable inherited from the caller, think about what could happen if the caller put something misleading in the variable, e.g., if the caller set [$HOME](#HOMEDIRREF) to /etc.

36.9. Portability Issues
========================

Â 

_

_It is easier to port a shell than a shell script._

_\--Larry Wall_

_

This book deals specifically with Bash scripting on a GNU/Linux system. All the same, users of **sh** and **ksh** will find much of value here.

As it happens, many of the various shells and scripting languages seem to be converging toward the [POSIX](#POSIX2REF) 1003.2 standard. Invoking Bash with the \--posix option or inserting a **set -o posix** at the head of a script causes Bash to conform very closely to this standard. Another alternative is to use a _#!/bin/sh_ [sha-bang header](#SHABANGREF) in the script, rather than _#!/bin/bash_. [\[129\]](#FTN.AEN20799) Note that /bin/sh is a [link](#LINKREF) to /bin/bash in Linux and certain other flavors of UNIX, and a script invoked this way disables extended Bash functionality.

Most Bash scripts will run as-is under **ksh**, and vice-versa, since Chet Ramey has been busily porting **ksh** features to the latest versions of Bash.

On a commercial UNIX machine, scripts using GNU-specific features of standard commands may not work. This has become less of a problem in the last few years, as the GNU utilities have pretty much displaced their proprietary counterparts even on "big-iron" UNIX. [Caldera's release of the source](http://linux.oreillynet.com/pub/a/linux/2002/02/28/caldera.html) to many of the original UNIX utilities has accelerated the trend.

Bash has certain features that the traditional [Bourne shell](#BASHDEF) lacks. Among these are:

*   Certain extended [invocation options](#INVOCATIONOPTIONSREF)
    
*   [Command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF) using **$( )** notation
    
*   [Brace expansion](#BRACEEXPREF3)
    
*   Certain [array](#ARRAYREF) operations, and [associative arrays](#ASSOCARR)
    
*   The [double brackets](#DBLBRACKETS) extended test construct
    
*   The [double-parentheses](#DBLPARENSREF) arithmetic-evaluation construct
    
*   Certain [string manipulation](#STRINGMANIP) operations
    
*   [Process substitution](#PROCESSSUBREF)
    
*   A Regular Expression [matching operator](#REGEXMATCHREF)
    
*   Bash-specific [builtins](#BUILTINREF)
    
*   [Coprocesses](#COPROCREF)
    

See the [Bash F.A.Q.](ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/FAQ) for a complete listing.

36.9.1. A Test Suite
--------------------

Let us illustrate some of the incompatibilities between Bash and the classic Bourne shell. Download and install the ["Heirloom Bourne Shell"](http://freshmeat.net/projects/bournesh) and run the following script, first using Bash, then the classic _sh_.

**Example 36-23. Test Suite**

#!/bin/bash
# test-suite.sh
# A partial Bash compatibility test suite.
# Run this on your version of Bash, or some other shell.

default\_option=FAIL         # Tests below will fail unless . . .

echo
echo -n "Testing "
sleep 1; echo -n ". "
sleep 1; echo -n ". "
sleep 1; echo ". "
echo

# Double brackets
String="Double brackets supported?"
echo -n "Double brackets test: "
if \[\[ "$String" = "Double brackets supported?" \]\]
then
  echo "PASS"
else
  echo "FAIL"
fi


# Double brackets and regex matching
String="Regex matching supported?"
echo -n "Regex matching: "
if \[\[ "$String" =~ R.....matching\* \]\]
then
  echo "PASS"
else
  echo "FAIL"
fi


# Arrays
test\_arr=$default\_option     # FAIL
Array=( If supports arrays will print PASS )
test\_arr=${Array\[5\]}
echo "Array test: $test\_arr"


# Command Substitution
csub\_test ()
{
  echo "PASS"
}

test\_csub=$default\_option    # FAIL
test\_csub=$(csub\_test)
echo "Command substitution test: $test\_csub"

echo

#  Completing this script is an exercise for the reader.
#  Add to the above similar tests for double parentheses,
#+ brace expansion, process substitution, etc.

exit $?

36.10. Shell Scripting Under Windows
====================================

Even users running _that other_ OS can run UNIX-like shell scripts, and therefore benefit from many of the lessons of this book. The [Cygwin](http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/) package from Cygnus and the [MKS utilities](http://www.mkssoftware.com/) from Mortice Kern Associates add shell scripting capabilities to Windows.

Another alternative is [UWIN](http://www2.research.att.com/~gsf/download/uwin/uwin.html), written by David Korn of AT&T, of [Korn Shell](#KORNSHELLREF) fame.

In 2006, Microsoft released the Windows PowershellÂ®, which contains limited Bash-like command-line scripting capabilities.

* * *

Chapter 37. Bash, versions 2, 3, and 4
======================================

37.1. Bash, version 2
=====================

The current version of _Bash_, the one you have running on your machine, is most likely version 2.xx.yy, 3.xx.yy, or 4.xx.yy.

bash$ **echo $BASH\_VERSION**
3.2.25(1)-release
	      

The version 2 update of the classic Bash scripting language added array variables, string and parameter expansion, and a better method of indirect variable references, among other features.

**Example 37-1. String expansion**

#!/bin/bash

# String expansion.
# Introduced with version 2 of Bash.

#  Strings of the form $'xxx'
#+ have the standard escaped characters interpreted. 

echo $'Ringing bell 3 times \\a \\a \\a'
     # May only ring once with certain terminals.
     # Or ...
     # May not ring at all, depending on terminal settings.
echo $'Three form feeds \\f \\f \\f'
echo $'10 newlines \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'
echo $'\\102\\141\\163\\150'
     #   B   a   s   h
     # Octal equivalent of characters.

exit

**Example 37-2. Indirect variable references - the new way**

#!/bin/bash

# Indirect variable referencing.
# This has a few of the attributes of references in C++.


a=letter\_of\_alphabet
letter\_of\_alphabet=z

echo "a = $a"           # Direct reference.

echo "Now a = ${!a}"    # Indirect reference.
#  The ${!variable} notation is more intuitive than the old
#+ eval var1=\\$$var2

echo

t=table\_cell\_3
table\_cell\_3=24
echo "t = ${!t}"                      # t = 24
table\_cell\_3=387
echo "Value of t changed to ${!t}"    # 387
# No 'eval' necessary.

#  This is useful for referencing members of an array or table,
#+ or for simulating a multi-dimensional array.
#  An indexing option (analogous to pointer arithmetic)
#+ would have been nice. Sigh.

exit 0

# See also, ind-ref.sh example.

**Example 37-3. Simple database application, using indirect variable referencing**

#!/bin/bash
# resistor-inventory.sh
# Simple database / table-lookup application.

# ============================================================== #
# Data

B1723\_value=470                                   # Ohms

B1725\_powerdissip=.125
B1725\_colorcode="brown-black-orange"
B1725\_loc=24N
B1725\_inventory=89

# ============================================================== #


echo

PS3='Enter catalog number: '

echo

select catalog\_number in "B1723" "B1724" "B1725"
do
  Inv=${catalog\_number}\_inventory
  Val=${catalog\_number}\_value
  Pdissip=${catalog\_number}\_powerdissip
  Loc=${catalog\_number}\_loc
  Ccode=${catalog\_number}\_colorcode

  echo
  echo "Catalog number $catalog\_number:"
  # Now, retrieve value, using indirect referencing.
  echo "There are ${!Inv} of  \[${!Val} ohm / ${!Pdissip} watt\]\\
  resistors in stock."  #        ^             ^
  # As of Bash 4.2, you can replace "ohm" with \\u2126 (using echo -e).
  echo "These are located in bin # ${!Loc}."
  echo "Their color code is \\"${!Ccode}\\"."

  break
done

echo; echo

# Exercises:
# ---------
# 1) Rewrite this script to read its data from an external file.
# 2) Rewrite this script to use arrays,
#+   rather than indirect variable referencing.
#    Which method is more straightforward and intuitive?
#    Which method is easier to code?


# Notes:
# -----
#  Shell scripts are inappropriate for anything except the most simple
#+ database applications, and even then it involves workarounds and kludges.
#  Much better is to use a language with native support for data structures,
#+ such as C++ or Java (or even Perl).

37.2. Bash, version 3
=====================

On July 27, 2004, Chet Ramey released version 3 of Bash. This update fixed quite a number of bugs and added new features.

Some of the more important added features:

*   A new, more generalized **{a..z}** [brace expansion](#BRACEEXPREF) operator.
    
    #!/bin/bash
    
    for i in {1..10}
    #  Simpler and more straightforward than
    #+ for i in $(seq 10)
    do
      echo -n "$i "
    done
    
    echo
    
    # 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    
    
    
    # Or just . . .
    
    echo {a..z}    #  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
    echo {e..m}    #  e f g h i j k l m
    echo {z..a}    #  z y x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a
                   #  Works backwards, too.
    echo {25..30}  #  25 26 27 28 29 30
    echo {3..-2}   #  3 2 1 0 -1 -2
    echo {X..d}    #  X Y Z \[  \] ^ \_ \` a b c d
                   #  Shows (some of) the ASCII characters between Z and a,

    # You can tack on prefixes and suffixes.
    echo "Number #"{1..4}, "..."
         # Number #1, Number #2, Number #3, Number #4, ...
    
    
    # You can concatenate brace-expansion sets.
    echo {1..3}{x..z}" +" "..."

         # a b c 1 2 3
         # The "comma operator" splices together strings.

    # Unfortunately, brace expansion does not lend itself to parameterization.
    var1=1
    var2=5
    echo {$var1..$var2}   # {1..5}
    
    
    # Yet, as Emiliano G. points out, using "eval" overcomes this limitation.
    
    start=0
    end=10
    for index in $(eval echo {$start..$end})
    do
      echo -n "$index "   # 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
    done
    
    echo
    
*   The **${!array\[@\]}** operator, which expands to all the indices of a given [array](#ARRAYREF).
    
    #!/bin/bash
    
    Array=(element-zero element-one element-two element-three)
    
    echo ${Array\[0\]}   # element-zero
                       # First element of array.
    
    echo ${!Array\[@\]}  # 0 1 2 3
                       # All the indices of Array.
    
    for i in ${!Array\[@\]}
    do
      echo ${Array\[i\]} # element-zero
                       # element-one
                       # element-two
                       # element-three
                       #
                       # All the elements in Array.
    done
    
*   The **\=~** [Regular Expression](#REGEXREF) matching operator within a [double brackets](#DBLBRACKETS) test expression. (Perl has a similar operator.)
    
    #!/bin/bash
    
    variable="This is a fine mess."
    
    echo "$variable"
    
    # Regex matching with =~ operator within \[\[ double brackets \]\].
    if \[\[ "$variable" =~ T.........fin\*es\* \]\]
    # NOTE: As of version 3.2 of Bash, expression to match no longer quoted.
    then
      echo "match found"
          # match found
    fi
    
    Or, more usefully:
    
    #!/bin/bash
    
    input=$1
    
    
    if \[\[ "$input" =~ "\[0-9\]\[0-9\]\[0-9\]-\[0-9\]\[0-9\]-\[0-9\]\[0-9\]\[0-9\]\[0-9\]" \]\]
    #                 ^ NOTE: Quoting not necessary, as of version 3.2 of Bash.
    # NNN-NN-NNNN (where each N is a digit).
    then
      echo "Social Security number."
      # Process SSN.
    else
      echo "Not a Social Security number!"
      # Or, ask for corrected input.
    fi
    
    For additional examples of using the **\=~** operator, see [Example A-29](#WHX), [Example 19-14](#MAILBOXGREP), [Example A-35](#FINDSPLIT), and [Example A-24](#TOHTML).
    
*   The new set -o pipefail option is useful for debugging [pipes](#PIPEREF). If this option is set, then the [exit status](#EXITSTATUSREF) of a pipe is the exit status of the last command in the pipe to _fail_ (return a non-zero value), rather than the actual final command in the pipe.
    
    See [Example 16-43](#FC4UPD).
    

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

The update to version 3 of Bash breaks a few scripts that worked under earlier versions. _Test critical legacy scripts to make sure they still work!_

As it happens, a couple of the scripts in the _Advanced Bash Scripting Guide_ had to be fixed up (see [Example 9-4](#TOUT), for instance).

* * *

37.2.1. Bash, version 3.1
-------------------------

The version 3.1 update of Bash introduces a number of bugfixes and a few minor changes.

*   The += operator is now permitted in in places where previously only the \= assignment operator was recognized.
    
    a=1
    echo $a        # 1
    
    a+=5           # Won't work under versions of Bash earlier than 3.1.
    echo $a        # 15
    
    a+=Hello
    echo $a        # 15Hello
    
    Here, += functions as a _string concatenation_ operator. Note that its behavior in this particular context is different than within a [let](#LETREF) construct.
    
    a=1
    echo $a        # 1
    
    let a+=5       # Integer arithmetic, rather than string concatenation.
    echo $a        # 6
    
    let a+=Hello   # Doesn't "add" anything to a.
    echo $a        # 6
    
    Jeffrey Haemer points out that this concatenation operator can be quite useful. In this instance, we append a directory to the $PATH.
    
    bash$ **echo $PATH**
    /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin/:/usr/games
    
    bash$ **PATH+=:/opt/bin**
    
    bash$ **echo $PATH**
    /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin/:/usr/games:/opt/bin
          
    

* * *

37.2.2. Bash, version 3.2
-------------------------

This is pretty much a bugfix update.

*   In [_global_ parameter substitutions](#PSGLOB), the pattern no longer anchors at the start of the string.
    
*   The \--wordexp option disables [process substitution](#PROCESSSUBREF).
    
*   The **\=~** [Regular Expression match operator](#REGEXMATCHREF) no longer requires [quoting](#QUOTINGREF) of the _pattern_ within [\[\[ ... \]\]](#DBLBRACKETS).
    
    ![Caution](../images/caution.gif)
    
    In fact, quoting in this context is _not_ advisable as it may cause _regex_ evaluation to fail. Chet Ramey states in the [Bash FAQ](#BASHFAQ) that quoting explicitly disables regex evaluation. See also the [Ubuntu Bug List](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-website/+bug/109931) and [Wikinerds on Bash syntax](http://en.wikinerds.org/index.php/Bash_syntax_and_semantics).
    
    Setting _shopt -s compat31_ in a script causes reversion to the original behavior.
    

* * *

37.3. Bash, version 4
=====================

Chet Ramey announced Version 4 of Bash on the 20th of February, 2009. This release has a number of significant new features, as well as some important bugfixes.

Among the new goodies:

*   Associative arrays. [\[130\]](#FTN.AEN21025)
    
    An _associative_ array can be thought of as a set of two linked arrays -- one holding the _data_, and the other the _keys_ that index the individual elements of the _data_ array.
    
    **Example 37-5. A simple address database**
    
    #!/bin/bash4
    # fetch\_address.sh
    
    declare -A address
    #       -A option declares associative array.
    
    address\[Charles\]="414 W. 10th Ave., Baltimore, MD 21236"
    address\[John\]="202 E. 3rd St., New York, NY 10009"
    address\[Wilma\]="1854 Vermont Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90023"
    
    
    echo "Charles's address is ${address\[Charles\]}."
    # Charles's address is 414 W. 10th Ave., Baltimore, MD 21236.
    echo "Wilma's address is ${address\[Wilma\]}."
    # Wilma's address is 1854 Vermont Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90023.
    echo "John's address is ${address\[John\]}."
    # John's address is 202 E. 3rd St., New York, NY 10009.
    
    echo
    
    echo "${!address\[\*\]}"   # The array indices ...
    # Charles John Wilma
    
    **Example 37-6. A somewhat more elaborate address database**

*   The new **coproc** builtin enables two parallel [processes](#PROCESSREF) to communicate and interact. As Chet Ramey states in the [Bash FAQ](#BASHFAQ) [\[131\]](#FTN.AEN21068) , ver. 4.01:

    Coprocesses use _file descriptors_. [File descriptors enable processes and pipes to communicate](#FDREF2).
    
    #!/bin/bash4
    # A coprocess communicates with a while-read loop.
    
    
    coproc { cat mx\_data.txt; sleep 2; }
    #                         ^^^^^^^
    # Try running this without "sleep 2" and see what happens.
    
    while read -u ${COPROC\[0\]} line    #  ${COPROC\[0\]} is the
    do                                 #+ file descriptor of the coprocess.

    But, be careful!
    
    #!/bin/bash4
    
    echo; echo
    a=aaa
    b=bbb
    c=ccc
    
    coproc echo "one two three"
    while read -u ${COPROC\[0\]} a b c;  #  Note that this loop
    do                                 #+ runs in a subshell.
      echo "Inside while-read loop: ";
      echo "a = $a"; echo "b = $b"; echo "c = $c"
      echo "coproc file descriptor: ${COPROC\[0\]}"
    done 
    
    # a = one
    # b = two
    # c = three
    # So far, so good, but ...
    
    echo "-----------------"
    echo "Outside while-read loop: "

    ![Caution](../images/caution.gif)
    
    The coprocess is _asynchronous_, and this might cause a problem. It may terminate before another process has finished communicating with it.
    
    #!/bin/bash4
    
    coproc cpname { for i in {0..10}; do echo "index = $i"; done; }

*   The new **mapfile** builtin makes it possible to load an array with the contents of a text file without using a loop or [command substitution](#ARRAYINITCS).
    
    #!/bin/bash4
    
    mapfile Arr1 < $0
    # Same result as     Arr1=( $(cat $0) )
    echo "${Arr1\[@\]}"  # Copies this entire script out to stdout.
    
    echo "--"; echo
    
    # But, not the same as   read -a   !!!
    read -a Arr2 < $0
    echo "${Arr2\[@\]}"  # Reads only first line of script into the array.
    
    exit
    
*   The [read](#READREF) builtin got a minor facelift. The \-t [timeout](#READTIMED) option now accepts (decimal) fractional values [\[132\]](#FTN.AEN21096) and the \-i option permits preloading the edit buffer. [\[133\]](#FTN.AEN21101) Unfortunately, these enhancements are still a work in progress and not (yet) usable in scripts.
    
*   [Parameter substitution](#PARAMSUBREF) gets _case-modification_ operators.
    
    #!/bin/bash4
    
    var=veryMixedUpVariable
    echo ${var}            # veryMixedUpVariable

    #         \*\*             All chars  --> lowercase.
    
*   The [declare](#DECLAREREF) builtin now accepts the \-l _lowercase_ and \-c _capitalize_ options.
    
    #!/bin/bash4
    
    declare -l var1            # Will change to lowercase
    var1=MixedCaseVARIABLE

    echo "$var2"               # Originally\_lowercase
    # NOT the same effect as     echo $var2 | tr a-z A-Z
    
*   [Brace expansion](#BRACEEXPREF) has more options.
    
    _Increment/decrement_, specified in the final term within braces.
    
    #!/bin/bash4
    
    echo {40..60..2}
    # 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60
    # All the even numbers, between 40 and 60.
    
    echo {60..40..2}
    # 60 58 56 54 52 50 48 46 44 42 40
    # All the even numbers, between 40 and 60, counting backwards.
    # In effect, a decrement.
    echo {60..40..-2}
    # The same output. The minus sign is not necessary.
    
    # But, what about letters and symbols?
    echo {X..d}
    # X Y Z \[  \] ^ \_ \` a b c d
    # Does not echo the \\ which escapes a space.
    
    _Zero-padding_, specified in the first term within braces, prefixes each term in the output with the _same number_ of zeroes.
    
    bash4$ **echo {010..15}**
    010 011 012 013 014 015
    
    bash4$ **echo {000..10}**
    000 001 002 003 004 005 006 007 008 009 010
          
    
*   [_Substring extraction_ on _positional parameters_](#SUBSTREXTREF4) now starts with [$0](#SCRNAMEPARAM) as the _zero-index_. (This corrects an inconsistency in the treatment of positional parameters.)
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # show-params.bash
    # Requires version 4+ of Bash.
    
    # Invoke this scripts with at least one positional parameter.

_Editorial comment_

Associative arrays? Coprocesses? Whatever happened to the lean and mean Bash we have come to know and love? Could it be suffering from (horrors!) "feature creep"? Or perhaps even Korn shell envy?

_Note to Chet Ramey:_ Please add only _essential_ features in future Bash releases -- perhaps _for-each_ loops and support for multi-dimensional arrays. [\[134\]](#FTN.AEN21179) Most Bash users won't need, won't use, and likely won't greatly appreciate complex "features" like built-in debuggers, Perl interfaces, and bolt-on rocket boosters.

* * *

37.3.1. Bash, version 4.1
-------------------------

Version 4.1 of Bash, released in May, 2010, was primarily a bugfix update.

*   The [printf](#PRINTFREF) command now accepts a \-v option for setting [array](#ARRAYREF) indices.
    
*   Within [double brackets](#DBLBRACKETS), the **\>** and **<** string comparison operators now conform to the [locale](#LOCALEREF). Since the locale setting may affect the sorting order of string expressions, this has side-effects on comparison tests within _\[\[ ... \]\]_ expressions.
    
*   The [read](#READREF) builtin now takes a \-N option (_read -N chars_), which causes the _read_ to terminate after _chars_ characters.
    
    **Example 37-8. Reading N characters**
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # Requires Bash version -ge 4.1 ...
    
    num\_chars=61
    
    read -N $num\_chars var < $0   # Read first 61 characters of script!
    echo "$var"
    exit
    
    ####### Output of Script #######
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # Requires Bash version -ge 4.1 ...
    
    num\_chars=61
    
*   [Here documents](#HEREDOCREF) embedded in [**$( ... )** command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF0) constructs may terminate with a simple **)**.
    
    **Example 37-9. Using a _here document_ to set a variable**
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # here-commsub.sh
    # Requires Bash version -ge 4.1 ...
    
    multi\_line\_var=$( cat <<ENDxxx
    ------------------------------
    This is line 1 of the variable
    This is line 2 of the variable
    This is line 3 of the variable
    ------------------------------
    ENDxxx)
    
    #  Rather than what Bash 4.0 requires:
    #+ that the terminating limit string and
    #+ the terminating close-parenthesis be on separate lines.
    
    # ENDxxx
    # )
    
    
    echo "$multi\_line\_var"
    
    #  Bash still emits a warning, though.
    #  warning: here-document at line 10 delimited
    #+ by end-of-file (wanted \`ENDxxx')
    

* * *

37.3.2. Bash, version 4.2
-------------------------

Version 4.2 of Bash, released in February, 2011, contains a number of new features and enhancements, in addition to bugfixes.

*   Bash now supports the the _\\u_ and _\\U_ _Unicode_ escape.
    
    Unicode is a cross-platform standard for encoding into numerical values letters and graphic symbols. This permits representing and displaying characters in foreign alphabets and unusual fonts.
    
    echo -e '\\u2630'   # Horizontal triple bar character.
    # Equivalent to the more roundabout:
    echo -e "\\xE2\\x98\\xB0"
                       # Recognized by earlier Bash versions.
    
    echo -e '\\u220F'   # PI (Greek letter and mathematical symbol)
    echo -e '\\u0416'   # Capital "ZHE" (Cyrillic letter)
    echo -e '\\u2708'   # Airplane (Dingbat font) symbol
    echo -e '\\u2622'   # Radioactivity trefoil
    
    echo -e "The amplifier circuit requires a 100 \\u2126 pull-up resistor."
    
    
    unicode\_var='\\u2640'
    echo -e $unicode\_var      # Female symbol
    printf "$unicode\_var \\n"  # Female symbol, with newline
    
    
    #  And for something a bit more elaborate . . .
    
    #  We can store Unicode symbols in an associative array,
    #+ then retrieve them by name.
    #  Run this in a gnome-terminal or a terminal with a large, bold font
    #+ for better legibility.
    
    declare -A symbol  # Associative array.
    
    symbol\[script\_E\]='\\u2130'
    symbol\[script\_F\]='\\u2131'
    symbol\[script\_J\]='\\u2110'
    symbol\[script\_M\]='\\u2133'
    symbol\[Rx\]='\\u211E'
    symbol\[TEL\]='\\u2121'
    symbol\[FAX\]='\\u213B'
    symbol\[care\_of\]='\\u2105'
    symbol\[account\]='\\u2100'
    symbol\[trademark\]='\\u2122'
    
    
    echo -ne "${symbol\[script\_E\]}   "
    echo -ne "${symbol\[script\_F\]}   "
    echo -ne "${symbol\[script\_J\]}   "
    echo -ne "${symbol\[script\_M\]}   "
    echo -ne "${symbol\[Rx\]}   "
    echo -ne "${symbol\[TEL\]}   "
    echo -ne "${symbol\[FAX\]}   "
    echo -ne "${symbol\[care\_of\]}   "
    echo -ne "${symbol\[account\]}   "
    echo -ne "${symbol\[trademark\]}   "
    echo
    
    ![Note](../images/note.gif)
    
    The above example uses the [**$' ... '**](#STRQ) _string-expansion_ construct.
    
*   When the _lastpipe_ shell option is set, the last command in a [pipe](#PIPEREF) _doesn't run in a subshell_.
    
    **Example 37-10. Piping input to a [read](#READREF)**
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # lastpipe-option.sh
    
    line=''                   # Null value.
    echo "\\$line = "$line""   # $line =
    
    echo
    
    shopt -s lastpipe         # Error on Bash version -lt 4.2.
    echo "Exit status of attempting to set \\"lastpipe\\" option is $?"
    #     1 if Bash version -lt 4.2, 0 otherwise.
    
    echo
    
    head -1 $0 | read line    # Pipe the first line of the script to read.
    #            ^^^^^^^^^      Not in a subshell!!!
    
    echo "\\$line = "$line""
    # Older Bash releases       $line =
    # Bash version 4.2          $line = #!/bin/bash
    
    This option offers possible "fixups" for these example scripts: [Example 34-3](#BADREAD) and [Example 15-8](#READPIPE).
    
*   Negative [array](#ARRAYREF) indices permit counting backwards from the end of an array.
    
    **Example 37-11. Negative array indices**
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # neg-array.sh
    # Requires Bash, version -ge 4.2.
    
    array=( zero one two three four five )   # Six-element array.
    #         0    1   2    3    4    5
    #        -6   -5  -4   -3   -2   -1
    
    # Negative array indices now permitted.
    echo ${array\[-1\]}   # five
    echo ${array\[-2\]}   # four
    # ...
    echo ${array\[-6\]}   # zero
    # Negative array indices count backward from the last element+1.
    
    # But, you cannot index past the beginning of the array.
    echo ${array\[-7\]}   # array: bad array subscript
    
    
    # So, what is this new feature good for?
    
    echo "The last element in the array is "${array\[-1\]}""
    # Which is quite a bit more straightforward than:
    echo "The last element in the array is "${array\[${#array\[\*\]}-1\]}""
    echo
    
    # And ...
    
    index=0
    let "neg\_element\_count = 0 - ${#array\[\*\]}"
    # Number of elements, converted to a negative number.
    
    while \[ $index -gt $neg\_element\_count \]; do
      ((index--)); echo -n "${array\[index\]} "
    done  # Lists the elements in the array, backwards.
          # We have just simulated the "tac" command on this array.
    
    echo
    
    # See also neg-offset.sh.
    
*   [Substring extraction](#SUBSTREXTR01) uses a negative _length_ parameter to specify an offset from the _end_ of the target string.
    
    **Example 37-12. Negative parameter in string-extraction construct**
    
    #!/bin/bash
    # Bash, version -ge 4.2
    # Negative length-index in substring extraction.
    # Important: It changes the interpretation of this construct!
    
    stringZ=abcABC123ABCabc
    
    echo ${stringZ}                              # abcABC123ABCabc
    #                   Position within string:    0123456789.....
    echo ${stringZ:2:3}                          #   cAB
    #  Count 2 chars forward from string beginning, and extract 3 chars.
    #  ${string:position:length}
    
    #  So far, nothing new, but now ...
    
                                                 # abcABC123ABCabc
    #                   Position within string:    0123....6543210
    echo ${stringZ:3:-6}                         #    ABC123
    #                ^
    #  Index 3 chars forward from beginning and 6 chars backward from end,
    #+ and extract everything in between.
    #  ${string:offset-from-front:offset-from-end}
    #  When the "length" parameter is negative, 
    #+ it serves as an offset-from-end parameter.
    
    #  See also neg-array.sh.

38.1. Author's Note
===================

Â 

_

__doce ut discas__

_(Teach, that you yourself may learn.)_

_

How did I come to write a scripting book? It's a strange tale. It seems that a few years back I needed to learn shell scripting -- and what better way to do that than to read a good book on the subject? I was looking to buy a tutorial and reference covering all aspects of the subject. I was looking for a book that would take difficult concepts, turn them inside out, and explain them in excruciating detail, with well-commented examples. [\[135\]](#FTN.AEN21281) In fact, I was looking for _this very book_, or something very much like it. Unfortunately, [it didn't exist](#KOCHANREF), and if I wanted it, I'd have to write it. And so, here we are, folks.

That reminds me of the apocryphal story about a mad professor. Crazy as a loon, the fellow was. At the sight of a book, any book -- at the library, at a bookstore, anywhere -- he would become totally obsessed with the idea that he could have written it, should have written it -- and done a better job of it to boot. He would thereupon rush home and proceed to do just that, write a book with the very same title. When he died some years later, he allegedly had several thousand books to his credit, probably putting even Asimov to shame. The books might not have been any good, who knows, but does that really matter? Here's a fellow who lived his dream, even if he was obsessed by it, driven by it . . . and somehow I can't help admiring the old coot.

* * *

38.2. About the Author
======================

Who is this guy anyhow?

The author claims no credentials or special qualifications, [\[136\]](#FTN.AEN21292) other than a compulsion to write. [\[137\]](#FTN.AEN21295)

This book is somewhat of a departure from his other major work, [HOW-2 Meet Women: The Shy Man's Guide to Relationships](http://bash.deta.in/hmw60.zip). He has also written the [Software-Building HOWTO](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO.html). Of late, he has been trying his (heavy) hand at fiction: [Dave Dawson Over Berlin (First Installment)](http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.epub) [Dave Dawson Over Berlin (Second Installment)](http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.II.epub) and [Dave Dawson Over Berlin (Third Installment)](http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.III.epub) . He also has a few _Instructables_ ([here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Morse-Code-Shield/), [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Haywired-Hackduino/), [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-DIY-SD-Card-Logging-Shield/), [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Binguino-An-Arduino-based-Bingo-Number-Generato/), [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Raspberry-Pi-Lapdock-Connection/), [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Raspberry-Pi-Arduino-Connection/), and [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Switchable-Dual-Voltage-33v5v-Hacduino/) to his (dis)credit.

A Linux user since 1995 (Slackware 2.2, kernel 1.2.1), the author has emitted a few software truffles, including the [cruft](http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/file/cruft-0.2.tar.gz) one-time pad encryption utility, the [mcalc](http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/apps/financial/mcalc-1.6.tar.gz) mortgage calculator, the [judge](http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/games/amusements/judge-1.0.tar.gz) ScrabbleÂ® adjudicator, the [yawl](http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/libs/yawl-0.3.2.tar.gz) word gaming list package, and the [Quacky](http://bash.deta.in/qky.README.html) anagramming gaming package. He got off to a rather shaky start in the computer game -- programming FORTRAN IV on a CDC 3800 (on paper coding pads, with occasional forays on a keypunch machine and a Friden Flexowriter) -- and is not the least bit nostalgic for those days.

Living in an out-of-the-way community with wife and orange tabby, he cherishes human frailty, especially his own. [\[138\]](#FTN.AEN21318)

* * *

38.3. Where to Go For Help
==========================

[The author](mailto:thegrendel.abs@gmail.com) is no longer supporting or updating this document. He will not answer questions about this book or about general scripting topics.

If you need assistance with a schoolwork assignment, read the pertinent sections of this and other reference works. Do your best to solve the problem using your own wits and resources. _Please do not waste the author's time._ You will get neither help nor sympathy. [\[139\]](#FTN.AEN21329)

Likewise, kindly refrain from annoying the author with solicitations, offers of employment, or "business opportunities." He is doing just fine, and requires neither help nor sympathy, thank you.

Please note that the author will _not_ answer scripting questions for Sun/Solaris/Oracle or Apple systems. The endarkened execs and the arachnoid corporate attorneys of those particular outfits have been using litigation in a predatory manner and/or as a weapon against the Open Source Community. Any Solaris or Apple users needing scripting help will therefore kindly direct their concerns to corporate customer service.

38.4. Tools Used to Produce This Book
=====================================

38.4.1. Hardware
----------------

A used IBM Thinkpad, model 760XL laptop (P166, 104 meg RAM) running Red Hat 7.1/7.3. Sure, it's slow and has a funky keyboard, but it beats the heck out of a No. 2 pencil and a Big Chief tablet.

_Update:_ upgraded to a 770Z Thinkpad (P2-366, 192 meg RAM) running FC3. Anyone feel like donating a later-model laptop to a starving writer <g>?

_Update:_ upgraded to a T61 Thinkpad running Mandriva 2011. No longer starving <g>, but not too proud to accept donations.

* * *

38.4.2. Software and Printware
------------------------------

1.  Bram Moolenaar's powerful SGML-aware [vim](http://www.vim.org) text editor.
    
2.  [OpenJade](http://www.netfolder.com/DSSSL/), a DSSSL rendering engine for converting SGML documents into other formats.
    
3.  [Norman Walsh's DSSSL stylesheets](http://nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl/).
    
4.  _DocBook, The Definitive Guide_, by Norman Walsh and Leonard Muellner (O'Reilly, ISBN 1-56592-580-7). This is still the standard reference for anyone attempting to write a document in Docbook SGML format.
    

* * *

38.5. Credits
=============

_Community participation made this project possible._ The author gratefully acknowledges that writing this book would have been unthinkable without help and feedback from all you people out there.

[Philippe Martin](mailto:feloy@free.fr) translated the first version (0.1) of this document into DocBook/SGML. While not on the job at a small French company as a software developer, he enjoys working on GNU/Linux documentation and software, reading literature, playing music, and, for his peace of mind, making merry with friends. You may run across him somewhere in France or in the Basque Country, or you can email him at [feloy@free.fr](mailto:feloy@free.fr).

Philippe Martin also pointed out that positional parameters past $9 are possible using {bracket} notation. (See [Example 4-5](#EX17)).

[StÃ©phane Chazelas](mailto:stephane_chazelas@yahoo.fr) sent a long list of corrections, additions, and example scripts. More than a contributor, he had, in effect, for a while taken on the role of _co-editor_ for this document. _Merci beaucoup!_

Paulo Marcel Coelho Aragao offered many corrections, both major and minor, and contributed quite a number of helpful suggestions.

I would like to especially thank _Patrick Callahan_, _Mike Novak_, and _Pal Domokos_ for catching bugs, pointing out ambiguities, and for suggesting clarifications and changes in the preliminary version (0.1) of this document. Their lively discussion of shell scripting and general documentation issues inspired me to try to make this document more readable.

I'm grateful to Jim Van Zandt for pointing out errors and omissions in version 0.2 of this document. He also contributed an instructive [example script](#ZFIFO).

Many thanks to [Jordi Sanfeliu](mailto:mikaku@fiwix.org) for giving permission to use his fine tree script ([Example A-16](#TREE)), and to Rick Boivie for revising it.

Likewise, thanks to [Michel Charpentier](mailto:charpov@cs.unh.edu) for permission to use his [dc](#DCREF) factoring script ([Example 16-52](#FACTR)).

Kudos to [Noah Friedman](mailto:friedman@prep.ai.mit.edu) for permission to use his string function script ([Example A-18](#STRING)).

[Emmanuel Rouat](mailto:emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr) suggested corrections and additions on [command substitution](#COMMANDSUBREF), [aliases](#ALIASREF), and [path management](#PATHMANAGEMENT). He also contributed a very nice sample .bashrc file ([Appendix M](#SAMPLE-BASHRC)).

[Heiner Steven](mailto:heiner.steven@odn.de) kindly gave permission to use his base conversion script, [Example 16-48](#BASE). He also made a number of corrections and many helpful suggestions. Special thanks.

Rick Boivie contributed the delightfully recursive _pb.sh_ script ([Example 36-11](#PBOOK)), revised the _tree.sh_ script ([Example A-16](#TREE)), and suggested performance improvements for the _monthlypmt.sh_ script ([Example 16-47](#MONTHLYPMT)).

Florian Wisser enlightened me on some of the fine points of testing strings (see [Example 7-6](#STRTEST)), and on other matters.

Oleg Philon sent suggestions concerning [cut](#CUTREF) and [pidof](#PIDOFREF).

Michael Zick extended the [empty array](#EMPTYARRAY) example to demonstrate some surprising array properties. He also contributed the _isspammer_ scripts ([Example 16-41](#ISSPAMMER) and [Example A-28](#ISSPAMMER2)).

Marc-Jano Knopp sent corrections and clarifications on DOS batch files.

Hyun Jin Cha found several typos in the document in the process of doing a Korean translation. Thanks for pointing these out.

Andreas Abraham sent in a long list of typographical errors and other corrections. Special thanks!

My gratitude to [Chet Ramey](mailto:chet@po.cwru.edu) and Brian Fox for writing _Bash_, and building into it elegant and powerful scripting capabilities rivaling those of _ksh_.

Very special thanks to the hard-working volunteers at the [Linux Documentation Project](http://www.tldp.org). The LDP hosts a repository of Linux knowledge and lore, and has, to a great extent, enabled the publication of this book.

Thanks and appreciation to IBM, Red Hat, Google, the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org), and all the good people fighting the good fight to keep Open Source software free and open.

Belated thanks to my fourth grade teacher, Miss Spencer, for emotional support and for convincing me that maybe, just maybe I wasn't a total loss.

Thanks most of all to my wife, Anita, for her encouragement, inspiration, and emotional support.

_The UNIX CD Bookshelf_, 3rd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 2003, 0-596-00392-7.

An array of seven UNIX books on CD ROM, including _UNIX Power Tools_, _Sed and Awk_, and _Learning the Korn Shell_. A complete set of all the UNIX references and tutorials you would ever need at about $130. Buy this one, even if it means going into debt and not paying the rent.

Update: Seems to have somehow fallen out of print. Ah, well. You can still buy the dead-tree editions of these books.

Appendix A. Contributed Scripts
===============================

These scripts, while not fitting into the text of this document, do illustrate some interesting shell programming techniques. Some are useful, too. Have fun analyzing and running them.

**Example A-1. _mailformat_: Formatting an e-mail message**

#!/bin/bash
# mail-format.sh (ver. 1.1): Format e-mail messages.

# Gets rid of carets, tabs, and also folds excessively long lines.

# =================================================================
#                 Standard Check for Script Argument(s)
ARGS=1
E\_BADARGS=85
E\_NOFILE=86

if \[ $# -ne $ARGS \]  # Correct number of arguments passed to script?
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` filename"
  exit $E\_BADARGS
fi

if \[ -f "$1" \]       # Check if file exists.
then
    file\_name=$1
else
    echo "File \\"$1\\" does not exist."
    exit $E\_NOFILE
fi
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

MAXWIDTH=70          # Width to fold excessively long lines to.

# =================================
# A variable can hold a sed script.
# It's a useful technique.
sedscript='s/^>//
s/^  \*>//
s/^  \*//
s/		\*//'
# =================================

#  Delete carets and tabs at beginning of lines,
#+ then fold lines to $MAXWIDTH characters.
sed "$sedscript" $1 | fold -s --width=$MAXWIDTH
                        #  -s option to "fold"
                        #+ breaks lines at whitespace, if possible.


#  This script was inspired by an article in a well-known trade journal
#+ extolling a 164K MS Windows utility with similar functionality.
#
#  An nice set of text processing utilities and an efficient
#+ scripting language provide an alternative to the bloated executables
#+ of a clunky operating system.

**Example A-2. _rn_: A simple-minded file renaming utility**

This script is a modification of [Example 16-22](#LOWERCASE).

#! /bin/bash
# rn.sh

# Very simpleminded filename "rename" utility (based on "lowercase.sh").
#
#  The "ren" utility, by Vladimir Lanin (lanin@csd2.nyu.edu),
#+ does a much better job of this.


ARGS=2
E\_BADARGS=85
ONE=1                     # For getting singular/plural right (see below).

if \[ $# -ne "$ARGS" \]
then
  echo "Usage: \`basename $0\` old-pattern new-pattern"
  # As in "rn gif jpg", which renames all gif files in working directory to jpg.
  exit $E\_BADARGS
fi

number=0                  # Keeps track of how many files actually renamed.


for filename in \*$1\*      #Traverse all matching files in directory.
do
   if \[ -f "$filename" \]  # If finds match...
   then
     fname=\`basename $filename\`            # Strip off path.
     n=\`echo $fname | sed -e "s/$1/$2/"\`   # Substitute new for old in filename.
     mv $fname $n                          # Rename.
     let "number += 1"
   fi
done   

if \[ "$number" -eq "$ONE" \]                # For correct grammar.
then
 echo "$number file renamed."
else

# Exercises:

# What types of files will this not work on?
# How can this be fixed?

**Example A-3. _blank-rename_: Renames filenames containing blanks**

This is an even simpler-minded version of previous script.

# blank-rename.sh
#
# Substitutes underscores for blanks in all the filenames in a directory.

number=0                  # Keeps track of how many files actually renamed.
FOUND=0                   # Successful return value.

for filename in \*         #Traverse all files in directory.
do
     echo "$filename" | grep -q " "         #  Check whether filename
     if \[ $? -eq $FOUND \]                   #+ contains space(s).
     then
       fname=$filename                      # Yes, this filename needs work.
       n=\`echo $fname | sed -e "s/ /\_/g"\`   # Substitute underscore for blank.
       mv "$fname" "$n"                     # Do the actual renaming.
       let "number += 1"
     fi
done

then
 echo "$number file renamed."
else 
 echo "$number files renamed."

**Example A-4. _encryptedpw_: Uploading to an ftp site, using a locally encrypted password**

#!/bin/bash

#+ eventually settles down to repeating "4,2,1..." cycles,
#+ even after fluctuating through a wide range of values.

#  Similar sounding names should have almost the same soundex codes.

#   Hargison = H-622
#   Harriman = H-655

#  This works out fairly well in practice, but there are numerous anomalies.

# Version 0.2:   Patched by Daniel Albers

# Version 0.2.1: Added 2-second delay between generations.

# ##################################################################### #
# This is the Bash script version of John Conway's "Game of Life".      #
# "Life" is a simple implementation of cellular automata.               #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# On a rectangular grid, let each "cell" be either "living" or "dead."  #
# Designate a living cell with a dot, and a dead one with a blank space.#
#      Begin with an arbitrarily drawn dot-and-blank grid,              #
#+     and let this be the starting generation: generation 0.           #
# Determine each successive generation by the following rules:          #
#   1) Each cell has 8 neighbors, the adjoining cells                   #
#+     left, right, top, bottom, and the 4 diagonals.                   #

# ==> Comments added by document author ==>


MATRIX="0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# ==> Password will consist of alphanumeric characters.
LENGTH="8"
# ==> May change 'LENGTH' for longer password.


while \[ "${n:=1}" -le "$LENGTH" \]
# ==> Recall that := is "default substitution" operator.
# ==> So, if 'n' has not been initialized, set it to 1.
do
	PASS="$PASS${MATRIX:$(($RANDOM%${#MATRIX})):1}"
	# ==> Very clever, but tricky.

	# ==> Starting from the innermost nesting...
	# ==> ${#MATRIX} returns length of array MATRIX.

	# ==> $RANDOM%${#MATRIX} returns random number between 1
	# ==> and \[length of MATRIX\] - 1.

	# ==> ${MATRIX:$(($RANDOM%${#MATRIX})):1}
	# ==> returns expansion of MATRIX at random position, by length 1. 
	# ==> See {var:pos:len} parameter substitution in Chapter 9.
	# ==> and the associated examples.

	# ==> PASS=... simply pastes this result onto previous PASS (concatenation).

	# ==> To visualize this more clearly, uncomment the following line
	#                 echo "$PASS"
	# ==> to see PASS being built up,

  # ==> Uses named pipe, /pipe, to communicate between processes:
  # ==> 'tar/gzip' writes to /pipe and 'ssh' reads from /pipe.

  # ==> The end result is this backs up the main directories, from / on down.

  # ==>  What are the advantages of a "named pipe" in this situation,

Patsie's version of a directory _tree_ script.

#!/bin/bash
# tree2.sh

# Lightly modified/reformatted by ABS Guide author.
# Included in ABS Guide with permission of script author (thanks!).

## Recursive file/dirsize checking script, by Patsie
##
## This script builds a list of files/directories and their size (du -akx)
## and processes this list to a human readable tree shape
## The 'du -akx' is only as good as the permissions the owner has.
## So preferably run as root\* to get the best results, or use only on
## directories for which you have read permissions. Anything you can't
## read is not in the list.

#\* ABS Guide author advises caution when running scripts as root!

# specified) echoes a string consisting of the first token on stdout. The
# function keeps track of its position in the string s1 between separate
# calls, so that subsequent calls made with the first argument an empty
# string will work through the string immediately following that token.  In
# this way subsequent calls will work through the string s1 until no tokens
# remain.  The separator string s2 may be different from call to call.

Walk an array of directory fields produced by ListDirectory

Having suppressed the line breaks in an otherwise line oriented
report, build an index to the array element which starts each line.

Each line gets two index entries, the first element of each line
(inode) and the element that holds the pathname of the file.

The first index entry pair (Line-Number==0) are informational:
Index-Array-Name\[0\] : Number of "Lines" indexed
Index-Array-Name\[1\] : "Current Line" pointer into Index-Array-Name

The following index pairs (if any) hold element indexes into
the Field-Array-Name per:
Index-Array-Name\[Line-Number \* 2\] : The "inode" field element.
NOTE: This distance may be either +11 or +12 elements.
Index-Array-Name\[(Line-Number \* 2) + 1\] : The "pathname" element.
NOTE: This distance may be a variable number of elements.
Next line index pair for Line-Number+1.

The key (no pun intended) to a Unified Content File System (UCFS)
is to distinguish the files in the system based on their content.
Distinguishing files by their name is just so 20th Century.

The content is distinguished by computing a checksum of that content.
This version uses the md5sum program to generate a 128 bit checksum
representative of the file's contents.
There is a chance that two files having different content might
generate the same checksum using md5sum (or any checksum).  Should
that become a problem, then the use of md5sum can be replace by a
cyrptographic signature.  But until then...

The md5sum program is documented as outputting three fields (and it
does), but when read it appears as two fields (array elements).  This
is caused by the lack of whitespace between the second and third field.
So this function gropes the md5sum output and returns:
	\[0\]	32 character checksum in hexidecimal (UCFS filename)
	\[1\]	Single character: ' ' text file, '\*' binary file
	\[2\]	Filesystem (20th Century Style) name
	Note: That name may be the character '-' indicating STDIN read.

StÃ©phane Chazelas demonstrates object-oriented programming in a Bash script.

Mariusz Gniazdowski contributed a [hash](#HASHREF) library for use in scripts.

**Example A-20. Library of hash functions**

\# Hash:
# Hash function library
# Author: Mariusz Gniazdowski <mariusz.gn-at-gmail.com>
# Date: 2005-04-07

# Functions making emulating hashes in Bash a little less painful.


#    Limitations:
#  \* Only global variables are supported.
#  \* Each hash instance generates one global variable per value.
#  \* Variable names collisions are possible
#+   if you define variable like \_\_hash\_\_hashname\_key
#  \* Keys must use chars that can be part of a Bash variable name
#+   (no dashes, periods, etc.).
#  \* The hash is created as a variable:
#    ... hashname\_keyname
#    So if somone will create hashes like:
#      myhash\_ + mykey = myhash\_\_mykey
#      myhash + \_mykey = myhash\_\_mykey
#    Then there will be a collision.
#    (This should not pose a major problem.)

Converting a text file to HTML format.

**Example A-24. Converting to HTML**

#!/bin/bash
# tohtml.sh \[v. 0.2.01, reldate: 04/13/12, a teeny bit less buggy\]

# Convert a text file to HTML format.
# Author: Mendel Cooper
# License: GPL3
# Usage: sh tohtml.sh < textfile > htmlfile
# Script can easily be modified to accept source and target filenames.

#    Assumptions:
# 1) Paragraphs in (target) text file are separated by a blank line.
# 2) Jpeg images (\*.jpg) are located in "images" subdirectory.
#    In the target file, the image names are enclosed in square brackets,
#    for example, \[image01.jpg\].
# 3) Emphasized (italic) phrases begin with a space+underscore
#+   or the first character on the line is an underscore,
#+   and end with an underscore+space or underscore+end-of-line.

    (Uncomment the above set command to see this action.)

    Remove the first (Sha-Bang) line when sourcing this as a library
    procedure.  Also comment out the example use code in the two

    Usage:

#  Looks as expected, but why all of the trouble?

# Declare an array for test values.

# Element 1: 'Hello ${Me}' is: 13 long. # Our "$(\_pls '...' )"
# Element 2: Hello ${You} is: 12 long.  # Quotes are missing
# Element 3: \\'Pass: \\' is: 10 long.    # ${pw} expanded to nothing

# Now make an assignment with that result.

#  Our Element 1 has had its leading and trailing hard quotes stripped.
#  Although not shown, leading and trailing whitespace is also stripped.
#  Now that the string contents are set, Bash will always, internally,
#+ hard quote the contents as required during its operations.

#  Why?
#  Considering our "$(\_pls 'Hello ${Me}')" construction:
#  " ... " -> Expansion required, strip the quotes.
#  $( ... ) -> Replace with the result of..., strip this.
#  \_pls ' ... ' -> called with literal arguments, strip the quotes.
#  The result returned includes hard quotes; BUT the above processing
#+ has already been done, so they become part of the value assigned.
#
#  Similarly, during further usage of the string variable, the ${Me}
#+ is part of the contents (result) and survives any operations
#  (Until explicitly told to evaluate the string).

#  Hint: See what happens when the hard quotes ($'\\x27') are replaced
#+ with soft quotes ($'\\x22') in the above procedures.
#  Interesting also is to remove the addition of any quoting.

#  Setting the contents of a string variable containing character

#
#  This problem is now solved in eight lines of code

#  Where is all this going?
#  Dynamic content Web pages as an array of Bash strings.
#  Content set per request by a Bash 'eval' command
#+ on the stored page template.
#  Not intended to replace PHP, just an interesting thing to do.
###
#  Don't have a webserver application?
#  No problem, check the example directory of the Bash source;
#+ there is a Bash script for that also.

Impatient?
    Application code: goto "# # # Hunt the Spammer' program code # # #"
    Example output: ":<<-'\_is\_spammer\_outputs\_'"
    How to use: Enter script name without arguments.
                Or goto "Quickstart" at end of script.

Provides
    Given a domain name or IP(v4) address as input:

    Does an exhaustive set of queries to find the associated
    network resources (short of recursing into TLDs).

    Checks the IP(v4) addresses found against Blacklist
    nameservers.

    If found to be a blacklisted IP(v4) address,
    reports the blacklist text records.
    (Usually hyper-links to the specific report.)

Requires
    A working Internet connection.
    (Exercise: Add check and/or abort if not on-line when running script.)
    Bash with arrays (2.05b+).

    The external program 'dig' --
    a utility program provided with the 'bind' set of programs.
    Specifically, the version which is part of Bind series 9.x
    See: http://www.isc.org

    All usages of 'dig' are limited to wrapper functions,
    which may be rewritten as required.
    See: dig\_wrappers.bash for details.
         ("Additional documentation" -- below)

Usage
    Script requires a single argument, which may be:
    1) A domain name;
    2) An IP(v4) address;
    3) A filename, with one name or address per line.

    Script accepts an optional second argument, which may be:
    1) A Blacklist server name;
    2) A filename, with one Blacklist server name per line.

    If the second argument is not provided, the script uses
    a built-in set of (free) Blacklist servers.

    See also, the Quickstart at the end of this script (after 'exit').

Return Codes
    0 - All OK
    1 - Script failure
    2 - Something is Blacklisted

Optional environment variables
    SPAMMER\_TRACE
        If set to a writable file,
        script will log an execution flow trace.

    SPAMMER\_DATA
        If set to a writable file, script will dump its
        discovered data in the form of GraphViz file.
        See: http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz

    SPAMMER\_LIMIT
        Limits the depth of resource tracing.

        Default is 2 levels.

        A setting of 0 (zero) means 'unlimited' . . .
          Caution: script might recurse the whole Internet!

        A limit of 1 or 2 is most useful when processing
        a file of domain names and addresses.
        A higher limit can be useful when hunting spam gangs.

    cat <<-'\_usage\_statement\_'
    The script is\_spammer.bash requires either one or two arguments.

    arg 1) May be one of:
        a) A domain name
        b) An IPv4 address
        c) The name of a file with any mix of names
           and addresses, one per line.

    arg 2) May be one of:
        a) A Blacklist server domain name
        b) The name of a file with Blacklist server
           domain names, one per line.
        c) If not present, a default list of (free)
           Blacklist servers is used.
        d) If a filename of an empty, readable, file
           is given,
           Blacklist server lookup is disabled.

    All script output is written to stdout.

    Return codes: 0 -> All OK, 1 -> Script failure,
                  2 -> Something is Blacklisted.

    Requires the external program 'dig' from the 'bind-9'
    set of DNS programs.  See: http://www.isc.org

    The domain name lookup depth limit defaults to 2 levels.
    Set the environment variable SPAMMER\_LIMIT to change.
    SPAMMER\_LIMIT=0 means 'unlimited'

    Limit may also be set on the command-line.
    If arg#1 is an integer, the limit is set to that value
    and then the above argument rules are applied.

    Setting the environment variable 'SPAMMER\_DATA' to a filename
    will cause the script to write a GraphViz graphic file.

    For the development version;
    Setting the environment variable 'SPAMMER\_TRACE' to a filename
    will cause the execution engine to log a function call trace.

Quickstart
==========

 Prerequisites

  Bash version 2.05b or 3.00 (bash --version)
  A version of Bash which supports arrays. Array 
  support is included by default Bash configurations.

  'dig,' version 9.x.x (dig $HOSTNAME, see first line of output)
  A version of dig which supports the +short options. 
  See: dig\_wrappers.bash for details.


 Optional Prerequisites

  'named,' a local DNS caching program. Any flavor will do.
  Do twice: dig $HOSTNAME 
  Check near bottom of output for: SERVER: 127.0.0.1#53
  That means you have one running.


 Optional Graphics Support

  'date,' a standard \*nix thing. (date -R)

  dot Program to convert graphic description file to a 
  diagram. (dot -V)
  A part of the Graph-Viz set of programs.
  See: \[http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz||GraphViz\]

  'dotty,' a visual editor for graphic description files.
  Also a part of the Graph-Viz set of programs.




 Quick Start

In the same directory as the is\_spammer.bash script; 
Do: ./is\_spammer.bash

 Usage Details

1. Blacklist server choices.

  (a) To use default, built-in list: Do nothing.

  (b) To use your own list: 

    i. Create a file with a single Blacklist server 
       domain name per line.

    ii. Provide that filename as the last argument to 
        the script.

  (c) To use a single Blacklist server: Last argument 
      to the script.

  (d) To disable Blacklist lookups:

    i. Create an empty file (touch spammer.nul)
       Your choice of filename.

    ii. Provide the filename of that empty file as the 
        last argument to the script.

2. Search depth limit.

  (a) To use the default value of 2: Do nothing.

  (b) To set a different limit: 
      A limit of 0 means: no limit.

    i. export SPAMMER\_LIMIT=1
       or whatever limit you want.

    ii. OR provide the desired limit as the first 
       argument to the script.

3. Optional execution trace log.

  (a) To use the default setting of no log output: Do nothing.

  (b) To write an execution trace log:
      export SPAMMER\_TRACE=spammer.log
      or whatever filename you want.

4. Optional graphic description file.

  (a) To use the default setting of no graphic file: Do nothing.

  (b) To write a Graph-Viz graphic description file:
      export SPAMMER\_DATA=spammer.dot
      or whatever filename you want.

5. Where to start the search.

  (a) Starting with a single domain name:

    i. Without a command-line search limit: First 
       argument to script.

    ii. With a command-line search limit: Second 
        argument to script.

  (b) Starting with a single IP address:

    i. Without a command-line search limit: First 
       argument to script.

    ii. With a command-line search limit: Second 
        argument to script.

  (c) Starting with (mixed) multiple name(s) and/or address(es):
      Create a file with one name or address per line.
      Your choice of filename.

    i. Without a command-line search limit: Filename as 
       first argument to script.

    ii. With a command-line search limit: Filename as 
        second argument to script.

6. What to do with the display output.

  (a) To view display output on screen: Do nothing.

  (b) To save display output to a file: Redirect stdout to a filename.

  (c) To discard display output: Redirect stdout to /dev/null.

7. Temporary end of decision making. 
   press RETURN 
   wait (optionally, watch the dots and colons).

8. Optionally check the return code.

  (a) Return code 0: All OK

  (b) Return code 1: Script setup failure

  (c) Return code 2: Something was blacklisted.

9. Where is my graph (diagram)?

The script does not directly produce a graph (diagram). 
It only produces a graphic description file. You can 
process the graphic descriptor file that was output 
with the 'dot' program.

Until you edit that descriptor file, to describe the 
relationships you want shown, all that you will get is 
a bunch of labeled name and address nodes.

All of the script's discovered relationships are within 
a comment block in the graphic descriptor file, each 
with a descriptive heading.

The editing required to draw a line between a pair of 
nodes from the information in the descriptor file may 
be done with a text editor. 

Given these lines somewhere in the descriptor file:

# Known domain name nodes

N0000 \[label="guardproof.info."\] ;

N0002 \[label="third.guardproof.info."\] ;



# Known address nodes

A0000 \[label="61.141.32.197"\] ;



/\*

# Known name->address edges

NA0000 third.guardproof.info. 61.141.32.197



# Known parent->child edges

PC0000 guardproof.info. third.guardproof.info.

 \*/

Turn that into the following lines by substituting node 
identifiers into the relationships:

# Known domain name nodes

N0000 \[label="guardproof.info."\] ;

N0002 \[label="third.guardproof.info."\] ;



# Known address nodes

A0000 \[label="61.141.32.197"\] ;



# PC0000 guardproof.info. third.guardproof.info.

N0000->N0002 ;



# NA0000 third.guardproof.info. 61.141.32.197

N0002->A0000 ;



/\*

# Known name->address edges

NA0000 third.guardproof.info. 61.141.32.197



# Known parent->child edges

PC0000 guardproof.info. third.guardproof.info.

 \*/

Process that with the 'dot' program, and you have your 
first network diagram.

In addition to the conventional graphic edges, the 
descriptor file includes similar format pair-data that 
describes services, zone records (sub-graphs?), 
blacklisted addresses, and other things which might be 
interesting to include in your graph. This additional 
information could be displayed as different node 
shapes, colors, line sizes, etc.

The descriptor file can also be read and edited by a 
Bash script (of course). You should be able to find 
most of the functions required within the 
"is\_spammer.bash" script.

# changelog:

# 07/02/2005.  Fixups by Little Monster.
# 02/02/2005.  Minor additions by Little Monster.
#              (See after # +++++++++++ )
# 29/01/2005.  Minor stylistic edits and cleanups by author of ABS Guide.
#              Added exit error codes.
# 22/11/2004.  Finished initial version of second version of wgetter:
#              wgetter2 is born.
# 01/12/2004.  Changed 'runn' function so it can be run 2 ways --
#              either ask for a file name or have one input on the CL.
# 01/12/2004.  Made sensible handling of no URL's given.
# 01/12/2004.  Made loop of main options, so you don't
#              have to keep calling wgetter 2 all the time.
#              Runs as a session instead.
# 01/12/2004.  Added looping to 'runn' function.
#              Simplified and improved.
# 01/12/2004.  Added state to recursion setting.
#              Enables re-use of previous value.
# 05/12/2004.  Modified the file detection routine in the 'runn' function
#              so it's not fooled by empty values, and is cleaner.
# 01/02/2004.  Added cookie finding routine from later version (which 
#              isn't ready yet), so as not to have hard-coded paths.
# =======================================================================

# ==> What is "podcasting"?

# ==> It's broadcasting "radio shows" over the Internet.
# ==> These shows can be played on iPods and other music file players.

# ==> This script makes it possible.
# ==> See documentation at the script author's site, above.

# ==> ################################################################


# Make script crontab friendly:
cd $(dirname $0)
# ==> Change to directory where this script lives.

# datadir is the directory you want podcasts saved to:
datadir=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
# ==> Will create a date-labeled directory, named: YYYY-MM-DD

# Check for and create datadir if necessary:
if test ! -d $datadir
        then
        mkdir $datadir
fi

# Delete any temp file:
rm -f temp.log

#  Read the bp.conf file and wget any url not already
#+ in the podcast.log file:
while read podcast
  do # ==> Main action follows.
  file=$(wget -q $podcast -O - | tr '\\r' '\\n' | tr \\' \\" | \\
sed -n 's/.\*url="\\(\[^"\]\*\\)".\*/\\1/p')

**Example A-32. Nightly backup to a firewire HD**

#!/bin/bash
# nightly-backup.sh
# http://www.richardneill.org/source.php#nightly-backup-rsync
# Copyright (c) 2005 Richard Neill <backup@richardneill.org>.
# This is Free Software licensed under the GNU GPL.
# ==> Included in ABS Guide with script author's kind permission.
# ==> (Thanks!)

#  This does a backup from the host computer to a locally connected
#+ firewire HDD using rsync and ssh.
#  (Script should work with USB-connected device (see lines 40-43).
#  It then rotates the backups.
#  Run it via cron every night at 5am.
#  This only backs up the home directory.
#  If ownerships (other than the user's) should be preserved,
#+ then run the rsync process as root (and re-instate the -o).
#  We save every day for 7 days, then every week for 4 weeks,
#+ then every month for 3 months.

#  See: http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync\_snapshots/
#+ for more explanation of the theory.
#  Save as: $HOME/bin/nightly-backup\_firewire-hdd.sh

#  Known bugs:
#  ----------
#  i)  Ideally, we want to exclude ~/.tmp and the browser caches.

#  ii) If the user is sitting at the computer at 5am,
#+     and files are modified while the rsync is occurring,
#+     then the BACKUP\_JUSTINCASE branch gets triggered.
#      To some extent, this is a 
#+     feature, but it also causes a "disk-space leak".

    on the command line.
    
    The directory for -r<n> or -R<n> may be a number.
    For example:

    and refer to 0:
        $ cd -s     Go to special entry 0
        $ cd -S     Go to special entry 0 and make special
                    entry 0 current dir

        Set the following environment variables:
            CDL\_PROMPTLEN  - Set to the length of prompt you require.
                Prompt string is set to the right characters of the
                current directory.
                If not set then prompt is left unchanged
            CDL\_PROMPT\_PRE - Set to the string to prefix the prompt.
                Default is:
                    non-root:  \\"\\\\\[\\\\e\[01;34m\\\\\]\\"  (sets colour to blue).
                    root:      \\"\\\\\[\\\\e\[01;31m\\\\\]\\"  (sets colour to red).
            CDL\_PROMPT\_POST    - Set to the string to suffix the prompt.
                Default is:

=======================================================================

cdll is a replacement for cd and incorporates similar functionality to
the bash pushd and popd commands but is independent of them.

This version of cdll has been tested on Linux using Bash. It will work
on most Linux versions but will probably not work on other shells without
modification.

Introduction
============

cdll allows easy moving about between directories. When changing to a new
directory the current one is automatically put onto a stack. By default
50 entries are kept, but this is configurable. Special directories can be
kept for easy access - by default up to 10, but this is configurable. The
most recent stack entries and the special entries can be easily viewed.

The directory stack and special entries can be saved to, and loaded from,
a file. This allows them to be set up on login, saved before logging out
or changed when moving project to project.

In addition, cdll provides a flexible command prompt facility that allows,
for example, a directory name in colour that is truncated from the left
if it gets too long.


Setting up cdll
===============

Copy cdll to either your local home directory or a central directory
such as /usr/bin (this will require root access).

Copy the file cdfile to your home directory. It will require read and
write access. This a default file that contains a directory stack and
special entries.

To replace the cd command you must add commands to your login script.
The login script is one or more of:

    /etc/profile
    ~/.bash\_profile
    ~/.bash\_login
    ~/.profile
    ~/.bashrc
    /etc/bash.bashrc.local
    
To setup your login, ~/.bashrc is recommended, for global (and root) setup
add the commands to /etc/bash.bashrc.local
    
To set up on login, add the command:
    . <dir>/cdll
For example if cdll is in your local home directory:
    . ~/cdll
If in /usr/bin then:
    . /usr/bin/cdll

If you want to use this instead of the buitin cd command then add:
    alias cd='cd\_new'
We would also recommend the following commands:
    alias @='cd\_new @'
    cd -U
    cd -D

If you want to use cdll's prompt facilty then add the following:
    CDL\_PROMPTLEN=nn
Where nn is a number described below. Initially 99 would be suitable
number.

Thus the script looks something like this:

    ######################################################################
    # CD Setup
    ######################################################################
    CDL\_PROMPTLEN=21        # Allow a prompt length of up to 21 characters
    . /usr/bin/cdll         # Initialise cdll
    alias cd='cd\_new'       # Replace the built in cd command
    alias @='cd\_new @'      # Allow @ at the prompt to display history
    cd -U                   # Upload directories
    cd -D                   # Set default action to non-posix
    ######################################################################

The full meaning of these commands will become clear later.

There are a couple of caveats. If another program changes the directory
without calling cdll, then the directory won't be put on the stack and
also if the prompt facility is used then this will not be updated. Two
programs that can do this are pushd and popd. To update the prompt and
stack simply enter:

    cd .
    
Note that if the previous entry on the stack is the current directory
then the stack is not updated.

Usage
=====  
cd \[dir\] \[0-9\] \[@\[s|h\] \[-g <dir>\] \[-d\] \[-D\] \[-r<n>\]
   \[dir|0-9\] \[-R<n>\] \[<dir>|0-9\] \[-s<n>\] \[-S<n>\]
   \[-u\] \[-U\] \[-f\] \[-F\] \[-h\] \[-H\] \[-v\]

    <dir>       Go to directory
    0-n         Goto previous directory (0 is previous,
                1 is last but 1, etc.)
                n is up to max history (default is 50)
    @           List history and special entries (Usually available as $ @)
    @h          List history entries
    @s          List special entries
    -g \[<dir>\]  Go to literal name (bypass special names)
                This is to allow access to dirs called '0','1','-h' etc
    -d          Change default action - verbose. (See note)
    -D          Change default action - silent. (See note)
    -s<n>       Go to the special entry <n>
    -S<n>       Go to the special entry <n>
                      and replace it with the current dir
    -r<n> \[<dir>\] Go to directory <dir>

Examples
========

These examples assume non-default mode is set (that is, cd with no
parameters will go to the most recent stack directory), that aliases
have been set up for cd and @ as described above and that cd's prompt
facility is active and the prompt length is 21 characters.

    /home/phil$ @
    # List the entries with the @
    History:
    # Output of the @ command
    .....
    # Skipped these entries for brevity
    1 /home/phil/ummdev               S1 /home/phil/perl
    # Most recent two history entries
    0 /home/phil/perl/eg              S0 /home/phil/umm/ummdev
    # and two special entries are shown
    
    /home/phil$ cd /home/phil/utils/Cdll
    # Now change directories
    /home/phil/utils/Cdll$ @
    # Prompt reflects the directory.
    History:
    # New history
    .....   
    1 /home/phil/perl/eg              S1 /home/phil/perl
    # History entry 0 has moved to 1
    0 /home/phil                      S0 /home/phil/umm/ummdev
    # and the most recent has entered
       
To go to a history entry:

    /home/phil/utils/Cdll$ cd 1
    # Go to history entry 1.
    /home/phil/perl/eg$
    # Current directory is now what was 1
    
To go to a special entry:

    /home/phil/perl/eg$ cd -s1
    # Go to special entry 1
    /home/phil/umm/ummdev$
    # Current directory is S1

To go to a directory called, for example, 1:

    /home/phil$ cd -g 1
    # -g ignores the special meaning of 1
    /home/phil/1$
    
To put current directory on the special list as S1:
    cd -r1 .        #  OR
    cd -R1 .        #  These have the same effect if the directory is
                    #+ . (the current directory)

To go to a directory and add it as a special  
  The directory for -r<n> or -R<n> may be a number.
  For example:
        $ cd -r3 4  Go to history entry 4 and put it on special entry 3
        $ cd -R3 4  Put current dir on the special entry 3 and go to
                    history entry 4
        $ cd -s3    Go to special entry 3

    Note that commands R,r,S and s may be used without a number and
    refer to 0:
        $ cd -s     Go to special entry 0
        $ cd -S     Go to special entry 0 and make special entry 0
                    current dir
        $ cd -r 1   Go to history entry 1 and put it on special entry 0
        $ cd -r     Go to history entry 0 and put it on special entry 0


    Alternative suggested directories:

    If a directory is not found, then CD will suggest any
    possibilities. These are directories starting with the same letters
    and if any are found they are listed prefixed with -a<n>
    where <n> is a number. It's possible to go to the directory
    by entering cd -a<n> on the command line.

        Use cd -d or -D to change default cd action. cd -H will show
        current action.

        The history entries (0-n) are stored in the environment variables
        CD\[0\] - CD\[n\]
        Similarly the special directories S0 - 9 are in the environment
        variable CDS\[0\] - CDS\[9\]
        and may be accessed from the command line, for example:
        
            ls -l ${CDS\[3\]}
            cat ${CD\[8\]}/file.txt

        The default pathname for the -f and -u commands is ~
        The default filename for the -f and -u commands is cdfile


Configuration
=============

    The following environment variables can be set:
    
        CDL\_PROMPTLEN  - Set to the length of prompt you require.
            Prompt string is set to the right characters of the current
            directory. If not set, then prompt is left unchanged. Note
            that this is the number of characters that the directory is
            shortened to, not the total characters in the prompt.

            CDL\_PROMPT\_PRE - Set to the string to prefix the prompt.
                Default is:
                    non-root:  "\\\\\[\\\\e\[01;34m\\\\\]"  (sets colour to blue).
                    root:      "\\\\\[\\\\e\[01;31m\\\\\]"  (sets colour to red).

            CDL\_PROMPT\_POST    - Set to the string to suffix the prompt.
                Default is:
                    non-root:  "\\\\\[\\\\e\[00m\\\\\]$"
                               (resets colour and displays $).
                    root:      "\\\\\[\\\\e\[00m\\\\\]#"
                               (resets colour and displays #).

        Note:
            CDL\_PROMPT\_PRE & \_POST only t

        CDPath - Set the default path for the -f & -u options.
                 Default is home directory
        CDFile - Set the default filename for the -f & -u options.
                 Default is cdfile


    There are three variables defined in the file cdll which control the
    number of entries stored or displayed. They are in the section labeled
    'Initialisation here' towards the end of the file.

        cd\_maxhistory       - The number of history entries stored.
                              Default is 50.
        cd\_maxspecial       - The number of special entries allowed.
                              Default is 9.
        cd\_histcount        - The number of history and special entries
                              displayed. Default is 9.

    Note that cd\_maxspecial should be >= cd\_histcount to avoid displaying
    special entries that can't be set.

#  Script author: Mkarcher
#  http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki  ...
#  /Script\_for\_configuring\_the\_CS4239\_sound\_chip\_in\_PnP\_mode
#  ABS Guide author made minor changes and added comments.
#  Couldn't contact script author to ask for permission to use, but ...
#+ the script was released under the FDL,
#+ so its use here should be both legal and ethical.

#  Sound-via-pnp-script for Thinkpad 600E
#+ and possibly other computers with onboard CS4239/CS4610
#+ that do not work with the PCI driver
#+ and are not recognized by the PnP code of snd-cs4236.
#  Also for some 770-series Thinkpads, such as the 770x.
#  Run as root user, of course.
#
#  These are old and very obsolete laptop computers,
#+ but this particular script is very instructive,
#+ as it shows how to set up and hack device files.



#  Search for sound card pnp device:

for dev in /sys/bus/pnp/devices/\*

# WSSDEV = /sys/bus/pnp/devices/00:07
# CTLDEV = /sys/bus/pnp/devices/00:06

 #+ OPL, port3: sb (unneeded)
 #       with ACPI-PnP:ports are: port1: OPL, port2: sb, port3: WSS
 #  (ACPI bios seems to be wrong here, the PnP-card-code in snd-cs4236.c
 #+  uses the PnPBIOS port order)

  if \[ ${port2%%-\*} = 0x388 \]

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
This is line one of an example paragraph, bla, bla, bla.
This is line two, and line three should follow on next line, but

there is a blank line separating the two parts of the paragraph.

**Example A-37. Standard Deviation**

#!/bin/bash
# sd.sh: Standard Deviation

#  The Standard Deviation indicates how consistent a set of data is.
#  It shows to what extent the individual data points deviate from the
#+ arithmetic mean, i.e., how much they "bounce around" (or cluster).
#  It is essentially the average deviation-distance of the
#+ data points from the mean.

# =========================================================== #
#    To calculate the Standard Deviation:
#
# 1  Find the arithmetic mean (average) of all the data points.
# 2  Subtract each data point from the arithmetic mean,
#    and square that difference.
# 3  Add all of the individual difference-squares in # 2.
# 4  Divide the sum in # 3 by the number of data points.
#    This is known as the "variance."
# 5  The square root of # 4 gives the Standard Deviation.

#  This may be a long, cobbled-together line, which groff
#  will automatically wrap and hyphenate.
#  However, if you want multiple (newline-separated) paragraphs,
#+ these must be inserted by manual text editing on the
#+ script-generated man page.
#  Exercise (difficult): Fix this!

#  This script is not nearly as elaborate as the
#+ full-featured "manedit" package
#+ http://freshmeat.net/projects/manedit/
#+ but it's much easier to use.

QUACKEY is a variant of Perquackey \[TM\].
The rules are the same, but the scoring is simplified
and plurals of previously played words are allowed.
"Vulnerable" play is not yet implemented,
but it is otherwise feature-complete.

As the game begins, the player gets 10 letters.
The object is to construct valid dictionary words
of at least 3-letter length from the letterset.
Each word-length category
-- 3-letter, 4-letter, 5-letter, ... --
fills up with the fifth word entered,
and no further words in that category are accepted.

The penalty for too-short (two-letter), duplicate, unconstructable,
and invalid (not in dictionary) words is -200. The same penalty applies
to attempts to enter a word in a filled-up category.

INSTRUCTION1

  echo -n "Hit ENTER for next page of instructions. "; read az1

     cat <<INSTRUCTION2

The scoring mostly corresponds to classic Perquackey:
The first 3-letter word scores    60, plus   10 for each additional one.
The first 4-letter word scores   120, plus   20 for each additional one.
The first 5-letter word scores   200, plus   50 for each additional one.
The first 6-letter word scores   300, plus  100 for each additional one.
The first 7-letter word scores   500, plus  150 for each additional one.
The first 8-letter word scores   750, plus  250 for each additional one.
The first 9-letter word scores  1000, plus  500 for each additional one.
The first 10-letter word scores 2000, plus 2000 for each additional one.

Category completion bonuses are:
3-letter words   100
4-letter words   200
5-letter words   400
6-letter words   800
7-letter words  2000
8-letter words 10000
This is a simplification of the absurdly baroque Perquackey bonus
scoring system.

INSTRUCTION2

  echo -n "Hit ENTER for final page of instructions. "; read az1

     cat <<INSTRUCTION3


Hitting just ENTER for a word entry ends the game.

Individual word entry is timed to a maximum of 10 seconds.
\*\*\* Timing out on an entry ends the game. \*\*\*
Aside from that, the game is untimed.

--------------------------------------------------
Game statistics are automatically saved to a file.
--------------------------------------------------

For competitive ("duplicate") play, a previous letterset
may be duplicated by repeating the script's random seed,
command-line parameter \\$1.
For example, "qky 7633" specifies the letterset 
c a d i f r h u s k ...

Nim is a game with roots in the distant past.
This particular variant starts with five rows of pegs.

1:    | | | | | 
2:     | | | | 
3:      | | | 
4:       | | 
5:        | 

The number at the left identifies the row.

The human player moves first, and alternates turns with the bot.
A turn consists of removing at least one peg from a single row.
It is permissable to remove ALL the pegs from a row.
For example, in row 2, above, the player can remove 1, 2, 3, or 4 pegs.
The player who removes the last peg loses.

The strategy consists of trying to be the one who removes
the next-to-last peg(s), leaving the loser with the final peg.

To exit the game early, hit ENTER during your turn.

# Recode the bot to use this strategy (rather difficult).

#  Curiosities:

#  Nim played a prominent role in Alain Resnais' 1961 New Wave film,

#
#  In 1978, Leo Christopherson wrote an animated version of Nim,

# A command-line Stopwatch

# Author: PÃ¡draig Brady
#    http://www.pixelbeat.org/scripts/sw
#    (Minor reformatting by ABS Guide author.)
#    Used in ABS Guide with script author's permission.
# Notes:
#    This script starts a few processes per lap, in addition to
#    the shell loop processing, so the assumption is made that
#    this takes an insignificant amount of time compared to
#    the response time of humans (~.1s) (or the keyboard
#    interrupt rate (~.05s)).
#    '?' for splits must be entered twice if characters
#    (erroneously) entered before it (on the same line).
#    '?' since not generating a signal may be slightly delayed
#    on heavily loaded systems.
#    Lap timings on ubuntu may be slightly delayed due to:
#    https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/62511
# Changes:
#    V1.0, 23 Aug 2005, Initial release
#    V1.1, 26 Jul 2007, Allow both splits and laps from single invocation.
#                       Only start timer after a key is pressed.
#                       Indicate lap number
#                       Cache programs at startup so there is less error
#                       due to startup delays.
#    V1.2, 01 Aug 2007, Work around \`date\` commands that don't have
#                       nanoseconds.
#                       Use stty to change interrupt keys to space for
#                       laps etc.
#                       Ignore other input as it causes problems.
#    V1.3, 01 Aug 2007, Testing release.
#    V1.4, 02 Aug 2007, Various tweaks to get working under ubuntu
#                       and Mac OS X.
#    V1.5, 27 Jun 2008, set LANG=C as got vague bug report about it.

# Exercises:
# ---------
#
# 1) Extend this example to a 10 x 10 board or larger.
# 2) Improve the "stupid strategy" by modifying the
#    do\_move\_stupid function.
#    Hint: Prevent straying into corner squares in early moves
#          (the exact opposite of Warnsdorff's algorithm!).
# 3) This script could stand considerable improvement and
#    streamlining, especially in the poorly-written
#    generate\_moves() function
#    and in the DECIDE-MOVE patch in the do\_move() function.
#    Must figure out why standard algorithm fails for startpos=37 ...
#+   but \_not\_ on any other, including symmetrical startpos=26.
#    Possibly, when calculating possible moves, counts the move back
#+   to the originating square. If so, it might be a relatively easy fix.

# Definition: A "magic square" is a two-dimensional array
#             of integers in which all the rows, columns,
#             and \*long\* diagonals add up to the same number.
#             Being "square," the array has the same number
#             of rows and columns. That number is the "order."
# An example of a magic square of order 3 is:
#   8  1  6   
#   3  5  7   
#   4  9  2   
# All the rows, columns, and the two long diagonals add up to 15.

# Exercises:
# ---------
# 1) Add a function to calculate the sum of each row, column,
#    and \*long\* diagonal. The sums must match.
#    This is the "magic constant" of that particular order square.
# 2) Have the print\_square function auto-calculate how much space
#    to allot between square elements for optimized display.
#    This might require parameterizing the "printf" line.
# 3) Add appropriate functions for generating magic squares
#    with an \*even\* number of rows/columns.
#    This is non-trivial(!).
#    See the URL for Kwon Young Shin, above, for help.

#  Most of the following points are described at length in
#+ the text of the foregoing "Advanced Bash Scripting Guide."
#  This demonstration script is mostly just a reorganized presentation.
#      -- msz

# Variables are not typed unless otherwise specified.

#  Variables are named. Names must contain a non-digit.
#  File descriptor names (as in, for example: 2>&1)
#+ contain ONLY digits.

# Parameters and Bash array elements are numbered.
# (Parameters are very similar to Bash arrays.)

# A variable name may be undefined (null reference).
unset VarNull

# A variable name may be defined but empty (null contents).
VarEmpty=''                         # Two, adjacent, single quotes.

# A variable name may be defined and non-empty.
VarSomething='Literal'

# A variable may contain:
#   \* A whole number as a signed 32-bit (or larger) integer
#   \* A string
# A variable may also be an array.

#  A string may contain embedded blanks and may be treated
#+ as if it where a function name with optional arguments.

#  The names of variables and the names of functions
#+ are in different namespaces.


#  A variable may be defined as a Bash array either explicitly or
#+ implicitly by the syntax of the assignment statement.
#  Explicit:
declare -a ArrayVar



# The echo command is a builtin.
echo $VarSomething

# The printf command is a builtin.
# Translate %s as: String-Format
printf %s $VarSomething         # No linebreak specified, none output.
echo                            # Default, only linebreak output.




# The Bash parser word breaks on whitespace.
# Whitespace, or the lack of it is significant.
# (This holds true in general; there are, of course, exceptions.)




# Translate the DOLLAR\_SIGN character as: Content-Of.

# Extended-Syntax way of writing Content-Of:
echo ${VarSomething}

#  The ${ ... } Extended-Syntax allows more than just the variable
#+ name to be specified.
#  In general, $VarSomething can always be written as: ${VarSomething}.

# Call this script with arguments to see the following in action.



#  Outside of double-quotes, the special characters @ and \*
#+ specify identical behavior.
#  May be pronounced as: All-Elements-Of.

#  Without specification of a name, they refer to the
#+ pre-defined parameter Bash-Array.



# Glob-Pattern references
echo $\*                         # All parameters to script or function
echo ${\*}                       # Same

# Bash disables filename expansion for Glob-Patterns.
# Only character matching is active.


# All-Elements-Of references
echo $@                         # Same as above
echo ${@}                       # Same as above




#  Within double-quotes, the behavior of Glob-Pattern references
#+ depends on the setting of IFS (Input Field Separator).
#  Within double-quotes, All-Elements-Of references behave the same.


#  Specifying only the name of a variable holding a string refers
#+ to all elements (characters) of a string.


#  To specify an element (character) of a string,
#+ the Extended-Syntax reference notation (see below) MAY be used.




#  Specifying only the name of a Bash array references
#+ the subscript zero element,
#+ NOT the FIRST DEFINED nor the FIRST WITH CONTENTS element.

#  Additional qualification is needed to reference other elements,
#+ which means that the reference MUST be written in Extended-Syntax.
#  The general form is: ${name\[subscript\]}.

#  The string forms may also be used: ${name:subscript}
#+ for Bash-Arrays when referencing the subscript zero element.


# Bash-Arrays are implemented internally as linked lists,
#+ not as a fixed area of storage as in some programming languages.


#   Characteristics of Bash arrays (Bash-Arrays):
#   --------------------------------------------

#   If not otherwise specified, Bash-Array subscripts begin with
#+  subscript number zero. Literally: \[0\]
#   This is called zero-based indexing.
###
#   If not otherwise specified, Bash-Arrays are subscript packed
#+  (sequential subscripts without subscript gaps).
###
#   Negative subscripts are not allowed.
###
#   Elements of a Bash-Array need not all be of the same type.
###
#   Elements of a Bash-Array may be undefined (null reference).
#       That is, a Bash-Array may be "subscript sparse."
###
#   Elements of a Bash-Array may be defined and empty (null contents).
###
#   Elements of a Bash-Array may contain:
#     \* A whole number as a signed 32-bit (or larger) integer
#     \* A string
#     \* A string formated so that it appears to be a function name
#     + with optional arguments
###
#   Defined elements of a Bash-Array may be undefined (unset).
#       That is, a subscript packed Bash-Array may be changed
#   +   into a subscript sparse Bash-Array.
###
#   Elements may be added to a Bash-Array by defining an element
#+  not previously defined.
###
# For these reasons, I have been calling them "Bash-Arrays".
# I'll return to the generic term "array" from now on.

# Put IFS back to the default.
# Default is exactly these three bytes.
IFS=$'\\x20'$'\\x09'$'\\x0A'           # In exactly this order.

# Interpretation of the above outputs:
#   A Glob-Pattern is I/O; the setting of IFS matters.
###
#   An All-Elements-Of does not consider IFS settings.
###
#   Note the different output using the echo command and the
#+  quoted format operator of the printf command.


#  Recall:
#   Parameters are similar to arrays and have the similar behaviors.
###
#  The above examples demonstrate the possible variations.
#  To retain the shape of a sparse array, additional script
#+ programming is required.
###
#  The source code of Bash has a routine to output the
#+ \[subscript\]=value   array assignment format.
#  As of version 2.05b, that routine is not used,
#+ but that might change in future releases.

# echo ${#test}                     # See that?



#  The length of an array, measured in defined elements,
#+ including null content elements.
echo
echo 'Defined content count: '${#ArrayVar\[@\]}' elements.'
# That is NOT the maximum subscript (4).
# That is NOT the range of the subscripts (1 . . 4 inclusive).
# It IS the length of the linked list.
###
#  Both the maximum subscript and the range of the subscripts may
#+ be found with additional script programming.

# The length of a string, measured in non-null elements (characters):
echo
echo '- - Quoted, Glob-Pattern references - -'
echo 'Non-Null character count: '"${#VarSomething}"' characters.'

#  The length of an array, measured in defined elements,

echo
echo 'Defined element count: '"${#ArrayVar\[\*\]}"' elements.'

#  Interpretation: Substitution does not effect the ${# ... } operation.
#  Suggestion:
#  Always use the All-Elements-Of character
#+ if that is what is intended (independence from IFS).



#  Define a simple function.

#  The difference between the unquoted and the double-quoted versions

# Restore the original setting trashed above.
VarSomething=Literal

#  There are a pair of functions demonstrated in the
#+ "protect\_literal.sh" and "unprotect\_literal.sh" examples.
#  These are general purpose functions for delayed replacement literals
#+ containing variables.





# REVIEW:
# ------

#  A string can be considered a Classic-Array of elements (characters).
#  A string operation applies to all elements (characters) of the string
#+ (in concept, anyway).
###
#  The notation: ${array\_name\[@\]} represents all elements of the
#+ Bash-Array: array\_name.
###
#  The Extended-Syntax string operations can be applied to all
#+ elements of an array.
###
#  This may be thought of as a For-Each operation on a vector of strings.
###
#  Parameters are similar to an array.
#  The initialization of a parameter array for a script
#+ and a parameter array for a function only differ
#+ in the initialization of ${0}, which never changes its setting.
###
#  Subscript zero of the script's parameter array contains
#+ the name of the script.
###
#  Subscript zero of a function's parameter array DOES NOT contain
#+ the name of the function.
#  The name of the current function is accessed by the $FUNCNAME variable.

# "Subscript sparse" Bash-Arrays

#+ relationship without change requires a bit of programming.
#  One possible code fragment:
###
# local l=${#ArraySparse\[@\]}        # Count of defined elements
# local f=0                         # Count of found subscripts
# local i=0                         # Subscript to test
(                                   # Anonymous in-line function
    for (( l=${#ArraySparse\[@\]}, f = 0, i = 0 ; f < l ; i++ ))
    do
        # 'if defined then...'
        ${ArraySparse\[$i\]+ eval echo '\\ \['$i'\]='${ArraySparse\[$i\]} ; (( f++ )) }
    done
)

# The reader coming upon the above code fragment cold
#+ might want to review "command lists" and "multiple commands on a line"
#+ in the text of the foregoing "Advanced Bash Scripting Guide."
###
#  Note:
#  The "read -a array\_name" version of the "read" command
#+ begins filling array\_name at subscript zero.
#  ArraySparse does not define a value at subscript zero.
###
#  The user needing to read/write a sparse array to either
#+ external storage or a communications socket must invent
#+ a read/write code pair suitable for their purpose.

# Exercise: clean it up.

Appendix C. A Sed and Awk Micro-Primer
======================================

This is a very brief introduction to the **sed** and **awk** text processing utilities. We will deal with only a few basic commands here, but that will suffice for understanding simple sed and awk constructs within shell scripts.

**sed**: a non-interactive text file editor

**awk**: a field-oriented pattern processing language with a **C**\-style syntax

For all their differences, the two utilities share a similar invocation syntax, use [regular expressions](#REGEXREF) , read input by default from stdin, and output to stdout. These are well-behaved UNIX tools, and they work together well. The output from one can be piped to the other, and their combined capabilities give shell scripts some of the power of [Perl](#PERLREF).

![Note](../images/note.gif)

One important difference between the utilities is that while shell scripts can easily pass arguments to sed, it is more cumbersome for awk (see [Example 36-5](#COLTOTALER) and [Example 28-2](#COLTOTALER2)).

* * *

C.1. Sed
========

_Sed_ is a non-interactive [\[141\]](#FTN.AEN23174) **s**tream **ed**itor. It receives text input, whether from stdin or from a file, performs certain operations on specified lines of the input, one line at a time, then outputs the result to stdout or to a file. Within a shell script, _sed_ is usually one of several tool components in a pipe.

_Sed_ determines which lines of its input that it will operate on from the _address range_ passed to it. [\[142\]](#FTN.AEN23185) Specify this address range either by line number or by a pattern to match. For example, _3d_ signals _sed_ to delete line 3 of the input, and _/Windows/d_ tells sed that you want every line of the input containing a match to "Windows" deleted.

Of all the operations in the _sed_ toolkit, we will focus primarily on the three most commonly used ones. These are **p**rinting (to stdout), **d**eletion, and **s**ubstitution.

**Table C-1. Basic sed operators**

Operator

Name

Effect

\[address-range\]/p

print

Print \[specified address range\]

\[address-range\]/d

delete

Delete \[specified address range\]

s/pattern1/pattern2/

substitute

Substitute pattern2 for first instance of pattern1 in a line

\[address-range\]/s/pattern1/pattern2/

substitute

Substitute pattern2 for first instance of pattern1 in a line, over _address-range_

\[address-range\]/y/pattern1/pattern2/

transform

replace any character in pattern1 with the corresponding character in pattern2, over _address-range_ (equivalent of **tr**)

\[address\] i pattern Filename

insert

Insert pattern at address indicated in file Filename. Usually used with \-i _in-place_ option.

g

global

Operate on _every_ pattern match within each matched line of input

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Unless the g (_global_) operator is appended to a _substitute_ command, the substitution operates only on the _first_ instance of a pattern match within each line.

From the command-line and in a shell script, a sed operation may require quoting and certain options.

sed -e '/^$/d' $filename
# The -e option causes the next string to be interpreted as an editing instruction.
#  (If passing only a single instruction to sed, the "-e" is optional.)
#  The "strong" quotes ('') protect the RE characters in the instruction
#+ from reinterpretation as special characters by the body of the script.
# (This reserves RE expansion of the instruction for sed.)
#
# Operates on the text contained in file $filename.

In certain cases, a _sed_ editing command will not work with single quotes.

filename=file1.txt
pattern=BEGIN

  sed "/^$pattern/d" "$filename"  # Works as specified.
# sed '/^$pattern/d' "$filename"    has unexpected results.
#        In this instance, with strong quoting (' ... '),
#+      "$pattern" will not expand to "BEGIN".

![Note](../images/note.gif)

_Sed_ uses the \-e option to specify that the following string is an instruction or set of instructions. If there is only a single instruction contained in the string, then this may be omitted.

sed -n '/xzy/p' $filename
# The -n option tells sed to print only those lines matching the pattern.
# Otherwise all input lines would print.
# The -e option not necessary here since there is only a single editing instruction.

**Table C-2. Examples of sed operators**

Notation

Effect

8d

Delete 8th line of input.

/^$/d

Delete all blank lines.

1,/^$/d

Delete from beginning of input up to, and including first blank line.

/Jones/p

Print only lines containing "Jones" (with \-n option).

s/Windows/Linux/

Substitute "Linux" for first instance of "Windows" found in each input line.

s/BSOD/stability/g

Substitute "stability" for every instance of "BSOD" found in each input line.

s/ \*$//

Delete all spaces at the end of every line.

s/00\*/0/g

Compress all consecutive sequences of zeroes into a single zero.

echo "Working on it." | sed -e '1i How far are you along?'

Prints "How far are you along?" as first line, "Working on it" as second.

5i 'Linux is great.' file.txt

Inserts 'Linux is great.' at line 5 of the file file.txt.

/GUI/d

Delete all lines containing "GUI".

s/GUI//g

Delete all instances of "GUI", leaving the remainder of each line intact.

Substituting a zero-length string for another is equivalent to deleting that string within a line of input. This leaves the remainder of the line intact. Applying **s/GUI//** to the line

**The most important parts of any application are its GUI and sound effects**

results in

The most important parts of any application are its  and sound effects

A backslash forces the **sed** replacement command to continue on to the next line. This has the effect of using the _newline_ at the end of the first line as the _replacement string_.

s/^  \*/\\
/g

This substitution replaces line-beginning spaces with a newline. The net result is to replace paragraph indents with a blank line between paragraphs.

An address range followed by one or more operations may require open and closed curly brackets, with appropriate newlines.

/\[0-9A-Za-z\]/,/^$/{
/^$/d
}

This deletes only the first of each set of consecutive blank lines. That might be useful for single-spacing a text file, but retaining the blank line(s) between paragraphs.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

The usual delimiter that _sed_ uses is /. However, _sed_ allows other delimiters, such as %. This is useful when / is part of a replacement string, as in a file pathname. See [Example 11-10](#FINDSTRING) and [Example 16-32](#STRIPC).

![Tip](../images/tip.gif)

A quick way to double-space a text file is **sed G filename**.

C.2. Awk
========

_Awk_ [\[143\]](#FTN.AEN23443) is a full-featured text processing language with a syntax reminiscent of _C_. While it possesses an extensive set of operators and capabilities, we will cover only a few of these here - the ones most useful in shell scripts.

Awk breaks each line of input passed to it into [fields](#FIELDREF). By default, a field is a string of consecutive characters delimited by [whitespace](#WHITESPACEREF), though there are options for changing this. Awk parses and operates on each separate field. This makes it ideal for handling structured text files -- especially tables -- data organized into consistent chunks, such as rows and columns.

[Strong quoting](#SNGLQUO) and [curly brackets](#CODEBLOCKREF) enclose blocks of awk code within a shell script.

\# $1 is field #1, $2 is field #2, etc.

echo one two | awk '{print $1}'
# one

echo one two | awk '{print $2}'
# two

# But what is field #0 ($0)?
echo one two | awk '{print $0}'
# one two
# All the fields!


awk '{print $3}' $filename
# Prints field #3 of file $filename to stdout.

awk '{print $1 $5 $6}' $filename
# Prints fields #1, #5, and #6 of file $filename.

awk '{print $0}' $filename
# Prints the entire file!
# Same effect as:   cat $filename . . . or . . . sed '' $filename

We have just seen the awk _print_ command in action. The only other feature of awk we need to deal with here is variables. Awk handles variables similarly to shell scripts, though a bit more flexibly.

{ total += ${column\_number} }

This adds the value of _column\_number_ to the running total of _total_\>. Finally, to print "total", there is an **END** command block, executed after the script has processed all its input.

END { print total }

Corresponding to the **END**, there is a **BEGIN**, for a code block to be performed before awk starts processing its input.

The following example illustrates how **awk** can add text-parsing tools to a shell script.

**Example C-1. Counting Letter Occurrences**

#! /bin/sh
# letter-count2.sh: Counting letter occurrences in a text file.
#
# Script by nyal \[nyal@voila.fr\].
# Used in ABS Guide with permission.
# Recommented and reformatted by ABS Guide author.
# Version 1.1: Modified to work with gawk 3.1.3.
#              (Will still work with earlier versions.)


INIT\_TAB\_AWK=""
# Parameter to initialize awk script.
count\_case=0
FILE\_PARSE=$1

E\_PARAMERR=85

usage()
{
    echo "Usage: letter-count.sh file letters" 2>&1
    # For example:   ./letter-count2.sh filename.txt a b c
    exit $E\_PARAMERR  # Too few arguments passed to script.
}

if \[ ! -f "$1" \] ; then
    echo "$1: No such file." 2>&1
    usage                 # Print usage message and exit.
fi 

if \[ -z "$2" \] ; then
    echo "$2: No letters specified." 2>&1
    usage
fi 

shift                      # Letters specified.
for letter in \`echo $@\`    # For each one . . .
  do
  INIT\_TAB\_AWK="$INIT\_TAB\_AWK tab\_search\[${count\_case}\] = \\
  \\"$letter\\"; final\_tab\[${count\_case}\] = 0; " 
  # Pass as parameter to awk script below.
  count\_case=\`expr $count\_case + 1\`
done

# DEBUG:
# echo $INIT\_TAB\_AWK;

cat $FILE\_PARSE |
# Pipe the target file to the following awk script.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Earlier version of script:
# awk -v tab\_search=0 -v final\_tab=0 -v tab=0 -v \\
# nb\_letter=0 -v chara=0 -v chara2=0 \\

awk \\
"BEGIN { $INIT\_TAB\_AWK } \\
{ split(\\$0, tab, \\"\\"); \\
for (chara in tab) \\
{ for (chara2 in tab\_search) \\
{ if (tab\_search\[chara2\] == tab\[chara\]) { final\_tab\[chara2\]++ } } } } \\
END { for (chara in final\_tab) \\
{ print tab\_search\[chara\] \\" => \\" final\_tab\[chara\] } }"
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Nothing all that complicated, just . . .
#+ for-loops, if-tests, and a couple of specialized functions.

exit $?

# Compare this script to letter-count.sh.

Doing it correctly: A quick summary
by David Wheeler
http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html

So, how can you process filenames correctly in shell? Here's a quick
summary about how to do it correctly, for the impatient who "just want the
answer". In short: Double-quote to use "$variable" instead of $variable,
set IFS to just newline and tab, prefix all globs/filenames so they cannot
begin with "-" when expanded, and use one of a few templates that work
correctly. Here are some of those templates that work correctly:


 IFS="$(printf '\\n\\t')"
 # Remove SPACE, so filenames with spaces work well.

 #  Correct glob use:
 #+ always use "for" loop, prefix glob, check for existence:
 for file in ./\* ; do          # Use "./\*" ... NEVER bare "\*" ...
   if \[ -e "$file" \] ; then    # Make sure it isn't an empty match.
     COMMAND ... "$file" ...
   fi
 done



 # Correct glob use, but requires nonstandard bash extension.
 shopt -s nullglob  #  Bash extension,
                    #+ so that empty glob matches will work.
 for file in ./\* ; do        # Use "./\*", NEVER bare "\*"
   COMMAND ... "$file" ...
 done



 #  These handle all filenames correctly;
 #+ can be unwieldy if COMMAND is large:
 find ... -exec COMMAND... {} \\;
 find ... -exec COMMAND... {} \\+ # If multiple files are okay for COMMAND.



 #  This skips filenames with control characters
 #+ (including tab and newline).
 IFS="$(printf '\\n\\t')"
 controlchars="$(printf '\*\[\\001-\\037\\177\]\*')"
 for file in $(find . ! -name "$controlchars"') ; do
   COMMAND "$file" ...
 done



 #  Okay if filenames can't contain tabs or newlines --
 #+ beware the assumption.
 IFS="$(printf '\\n\\t')"
 for file in $(find .) ; do
   COMMAND "$file" ...
 done



 # Requires nonstandard but common extensions in find and xargs:
 find . -print0 | xargs -0 COMMAND

 # Requires nonstandard extensions to find and to shell (bash works).
 # variables might not stay set once the loop ends:
 find . -print0 | while IFS="" read -r -d "" file ; do ...
   COMMAND "$file" # Use quoted "$file", not $file, everywhere.
 done



 #  Requires nonstandard extensions to find and to shell (bash works).
 #  Underlying system must include named pipes (FIFOs)
 #+ or the /dev/fd mechanism.
 #  In this version, variables \*do\* stay set after the loop ends,
 #  and you can read from stdin.
 #+ (Change the 4 to another number if fd 4 is needed.)

 while IFS="" read -r -d "" file <&4 ; do
   COMMAND "$file"   # Use quoted "$file" -- not $file, everywhere.
 done 4< <(find . -print0)


 #  Named pipe version.
 #  Requires nonstandard extensions to find and to shell's read (bash ok).
 #  Underlying system must include named pipes (FIFOs).
 #  Again, in this version, variables \*do\* stay set after the loop ends,
 #  and you can read from stdin.
 # (Change the 4 to something else if fd 4 needed).

 mkfifo mypipe

 find . -print0 > mypipe &
 while IFS="" read -r -d "" file <&4 ; do
   COMMAND "$file" # Use quoted "$file", not $file, everywhere.
 done 4< mypipe

Appendix E. Exit Codes With Special Meanings
============================================

**Table E-1. _Reserved_ Exit Codes**

Exit Code Number

Meaning

Example

Comments

1

Catchall for general errors

let "var1 = 1/0"

Miscellaneous errors, such as "divide by zero" and other impermissible operations

2

Misuse of shell builtins (according to Bash documentation)

empty\_function() {}

[Missing keyword](#MISSINGKEYWORD) or command, or permission problem (and [_diff_ return code on a failed binary file comparison](#DIFFERR2)).

126

Command invoked cannot execute

/dev/null

Permission problem or command is not an executable

127

"command not found"

illegal\_command

Possible problem with $PATH or a typo

128

Invalid argument to [exit](#EXITCOMMANDREF)

exit 3.14159

**exit** takes only integer args in the range 0 - 255 (see first footnote)

128+n

Fatal error signal "n"

_kill -9_ $PPID of script

**$?** returns 137 (128 + 9)

130

Script terminated by Control-C

_Ctl-C_

Control-C is fatal error signal 2, (130 = 128 + 2, see above)

255\*

Exit status out of range

exit \-1

**exit** takes only integer args in the range 0 - 255

According to the above table, exit codes 1 - 2, 126 - 165, and 255 [\[144\]](#FTN.AEN23629) have special meanings, and should therefore be avoided for user-specified exit parameters. Ending a script with _exit 127_ would certainly cause confusion when troubleshooting (is the error code a "command not found" or a user-defined one?). However, many scripts use an _exit 1_ as a general bailout-upon-error. Since exit code 1 signifies so many possible errors, it is not particularly useful in debugging.

There has been an attempt to systematize exit status numbers (see /usr/include/sysexits.h), but this is intended for C and C++ programmers. A similar standard for scripting might be appropriate. The author of this document proposes restricting user-defined exit codes to the range 64 - 113 (in addition to 0, for success), to conform with the C/C++ standard. This would allot 50 valid codes, and make troubleshooting scripts more straightforward. [\[145\]](#FTN.AEN23647) All user-defined exit codes in the accompanying examples to this document conform to this standard, except where overriding circumstances exist, as in [Example 9-2](#TMDIN).

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Issuing a [$?](#XSTATVARREF) from the command-line after a shell script exits gives results consistent with the table above only from the Bash or _sh_ prompt. Running the _C-shell_ or _tcsh_ may give different values in some cases.

A command expects the first three [file descriptors](#FDREF) to be available. The first, _fd 0_ (standard input, stdin), is for reading. The other two (_fd 1_, stdout and _fd 2_, stderr) are for writing.

There is a stdin, stdout, and a stderr associated with each command. **ls 2>&1** means temporarily connecting the stderr of the **ls** command to the same "resource" as the shell's stdout.

By convention, a command reads its input from fd 0 (stdin), prints normal output to fd 1 (stdout), and error ouput to fd 2 (stderr). If one of those three fd's is not open, you may encounter problems:

bash$ **cat /etc/passwd >&-**
cat: standard output: Bad file descriptor
      

For example, when **xterm** runs, it first initializes itself. Before running the user's shell, **xterm** opens the terminal device (/dev/pts/<n> or something similar) three times.

At this point, Bash inherits these three file descriptors, and each command (child process) run by Bash inherits them in turn, except when you redirect the command. [Redirection](#IOREDIRREF) means reassigning one of the file descriptors to another file (or a pipe, or anything permissible). File descriptors may be reassigned locally (for a command, a command group, a [subshell](#SUBSHELLSREF), a [while or if or case or for loop](#REDIRREF)...), or globally, for the remainder of the shell (using [exec](#EXECREF)).

**ls > /dev/null** means running **ls** with its fd 1 connected to /dev/null.

bash$ **lsof -a -p $$ -d0,1,2**
COMMAND PID     USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME
 bash    363 bozo        0u   CHR  136,1         3 /dev/pts/1
 bash    363 bozo        1u   CHR  136,1         3 /dev/pts/1
 bash    363 bozo        2u   CHR  136,1         3 /dev/pts/1

bash$ **exec 2> /dev/null**
bash$ **lsof -a -p $$ -d0,1,2**
COMMAND PID     USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME
 bash    371 bozo        0u   CHR  136,1         3 /dev/pts/1
 bash    371 bozo        1u   CHR  136,1         3 /dev/pts/1
 bash    371 bozo        2w   CHR    1,3       120 /dev/null

bash$ **bash -c 'lsof -a -p $$ -d0,1,2' | cat**
COMMAND PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME
 lsof    379 root    0u   CHR  136,1         3 /dev/pts/1
 lsof    379 root    1w  FIFO    0,0      7118 pipe
 lsof    379 root    2u   CHR  136,1         3 /dev/pts/1

bash$ **echo "$(bash -c 'lsof -a -p $$ -d0,1,2' 2>&1)"**
COMMAND PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME
 lsof    426 root    0u   CHR  136,1         3 /dev/pts/1
 lsof    426 root    1w  FIFO    0,0      7520 pipe
 lsof    426 root    2w  FIFO    0,0      7520 pipe

This works for different types of redirection.

**Exercise:** Analyze the following script.

#! /usr/bin/env bash

mkfifo /tmp/fifo1 /tmp/fifo2
while read a; do echo "FIFO1: $a"; done < /tmp/fifo1 & exec 7> /tmp/fifo1
exec 8> >(while read a; do echo "FD8: $a, to fd7"; done >&7)

exec 3>&1
(
 (
  (
   while read a; do echo "FIFO2: $a"; done < /tmp/fifo2 | tee /dev/stderr \\
   | tee /dev/fd/4 | tee /dev/fd/5 | tee /dev/fd/6 >&7 & exec 3> /tmp/fifo2

   echo 1st, to stdout
   sleep 1
   echo 2nd, to stderr >&2
   sleep 1
   echo 3rd, to fd 3 >&3
   sleep 1
   echo 4th, to fd 4 >&4
   sleep 1
   echo 5th, to fd 5 >&5
   sleep 1
   echo 6th, through a pipe | sed 's/.\*/PIPE: &, to fd 5/' >&5
   sleep 1
   echo 7th, to fd 6 >&6
   sleep 1
   echo 8th, to fd 7 >&7
   sleep 1
   echo 9th, to fd 8 >&8

  ) 4>&1 >&3 3>&- | while read a; do echo "FD4: $a"; done 1>&3 5>&- 6>&-
 ) 5>&1 >&3 | while read a; do echo "FD5: $a"; done 1>&3 6>&-
) 6>&1 >&3 | while read a; do echo "FD6: $a"; done 3>&-

rm -f /tmp/fifo1 /tmp/fifo2


# For each command and subshell, figure out which fd points to what.
# Good luck!

exit 0

Appendix G. Command-Line Options
================================

Many executables, whether binaries or script files, accept options to modify their run-time behavior. For example: from the command-line, typing **command -o** would invoke _command_, with option o.

* * *

G.1. Standard Command-Line Options
==================================

Over time, there has evolved a loose standard for the meanings of command-line option flags. The GNU utilities conform more closely to this "standard" than older UNIX utilities.

Traditionally, UNIX command-line options consist of a dash, followed by one or more lowercase letters. The GNU utilities added a double-dash, followed by a complete word or compound word.

The two most widely-accepted options are:

*   \-h
    
    \--help
    
    _Help_: Give usage message and exit.
    
*   \-v
    
    \--version
    
    _Version_: Show program version and exit.
    

Other common options are:

*   \-a
    
    \--all
    
    _All_: show _all_ information or operate on _all_ arguments.
    
*   \-l
    
    \--list
    
    _List_: list files or arguments without taking other action.
    
*   \-o
    
    _Output_ filename
    
*   \-q
    
    \--quiet
    
    _Quiet_: suppress stdout.
    
*   \-r
    
    \-R
    
    \--recursive
    
    _Recursive_: Operate recursively (down directory tree).
    
*   \-v
    
    \--verbose
    
    _Verbose_: output additional information to stdout or stderr.
    
*   \-z
    
    \--compress
    
    _Compress_: apply compression (usually [gzip](#GZIPREF)).
    

However:

*   In **tar** and **gawk**:
    
    \-f
    
    \--file
    
    _File_: filename follows.
    
*   In **cp**, **mv**, **rm**:
    
    \-f
    
    \--force
    
    _Force_: force overwrite of target file(s).
    

![Caution](../images/caution.gif)

Many UNIX and Linux utilities deviate from this "standard," so it is dangerous to _assume_ that a given option will behave in a standard way. Always check the man page for the command in question when in doubt.

A complete table of recommended options for the GNU utilities is available at [the GNU standards page](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/).

* * *

G.2. Bash Command-Line Options
==============================

_Bash_ itself has a number of command-line options. Here are some of the more useful ones.

*   \-c
    
    _Read commands from the following string and assign any arguments to the [positional parameters](#POSPARAMREF)._
    
    bash$ **bash -c 'set a b c d; IFS="+-;"; echo "$\*"'**
    a+b+c+d
    	      
    
*   \-r
    
    \--restricted
    
    _Runs the shell, or a script, in [restricted mode](#RESTRICTEDSHREF)._
    
*   \--posix
    
    _Forces Bash to conform to [POSIX](#POSIX2REF) mode._
    
*   \--version
    
    _Display Bash version information and exit._
    
*   \--
    
    _End of options. Anything further on the command line is an argument, not an option._
    

* * *

Appendix H. Important Files
===========================

**startup files**

These files contain the aliases and [environmental variables](#ENVREF) made available to Bash running as a user shell and to all Bash scripts invoked after system initialization.

/etc/profile

Systemwide defaults, mostly setting the environment (all Bourne-type shells, not just Bash [\[146\]](#FTN.AEN23892))

/etc/bashrc

systemwide functions and [aliases](#ALIASREF) for Bash

$HOME/.bash\_profile

user-specific Bash environmental default settings, found in each user's home directory (the local counterpart to /etc/profile)

$HOME/.bashrc

user-specific Bash init file, found in each user's home directory (the local counterpart to /etc/bashrc). Only interactive shells and user scripts read this file. See [Appendix M](#SAMPLE-BASHRC) for a sample .bashrc file.

**logout file**

$HOME/.bash\_logout

user-specific instruction file, found in each user's home directory. Upon exit from a login (Bash) shell, the commands in this file execute.

**data files**

/etc/passwd

A listing of all the user accounts on the system, their identities, their home directories, the groups they belong to, and their default shell. Note that the user passwords are _not_ stored in this file, [\[147\]](#FTN.AEN23937) but in /etc/shadow in encrypted form.

**system configuration files**

/etc/sysconfig/hwconf

Listing and description of attached hardware devices. This information is in text form and can be extracted and parsed.

bash$ **grep -A 5 AUDIO /etc/sysconfig/hwconf**	      
class: AUDIO
 bus: PCI
 detached: 0
 driver: snd-intel8x0
 desc: "Intel Corporation 82801CA/CAM AC'97 Audio Controller"
 vendorId: 8086
 

![Note](../images/note.gif)

This file is present on Red Hat and Fedora Core installations, but may be missing from other distros.

* * *

Appendix I. Important System Directories
========================================

Sysadmins and anyone else writing administrative scripts should be intimately familiar with the following system directories.

*   /bin
    
    Binaries (executables). Basic system programs and utilities (such as **bash**).
    
*   /usr/bin [\[148\]](#FTN.AEN23969)
    
    More system binaries.
    
*   /usr/local/bin
    
    Miscellaneous binaries local to the particular machine.
    
*   /sbin
    
    System binaries. Basic system administrative programs and utilities (such as **fsck**).
    
*   /usr/sbin
    
    More system administrative programs and utilities.
    
*   /etc
    
    _Et cetera_. Systemwide configuration scripts.
    
    Of particular interest are the [/etc/fstab](#FSTABREF) (filesystem table), /etc/mtab (mounted filesystem table), and the [/etc/inittab](#INITTABREF) files.
    
*   /etc/rc.d
    
    Boot scripts, on Red Hat and derivative distributions of Linux.
    
*   /usr/share/doc
    
    Documentation for installed packages.
    
*   /usr/man
    
    The systemwide [manpages](#MANREF).
    
*   /dev
    
    Device directory. Entries (but _not_ mount points) for physical and virtual devices. See [Chapter 29](#DEVPROC).
    
*   /proc
    
    Process directory. Contains information and statistics about running processes and kernel parameters. See [Chapter 29](#DEVPROC).
    
*   /sys
    
    Systemwide device directory. Contains information and statistics about device and device names. This is newly added to Linux with the 2.6.X kernels.
    
*   /mnt
    
    _Mount_. Directory for mounting hard drive partitions, such as /mnt/dos, and physical devices. In newer Linux distros, the /media directory has taken over as the preferred mount point for I/O devices.
    
*   /media
    
    In newer Linux distros, the preferred mount point for I/O devices, such as CD/DVD drives or USB flash drives.
    
*   /var
    
    _Variable_ (changeable) system files. This is a catchall "scratchpad" directory for data generated while a Linux/UNIX machine is running.
    
*   /var/log
    
    Systemwide log files.
    
*   /var/spool/mail
    
    User mail spool.
    
*   /lib
    
    Systemwide library files.
    
*   /usr/lib
    
    More systemwide library files.
    
*   /tmp
    
    System temporary files.
    
*   /boot
    
    System _boot_ directory. The kernel, module links, system map, and boot manager reside here.
    
    ![Warning](../images/warning.gif)
    
    Altering files in this directory may result in an unbootable system.

Appendix J. An Introduction to Programmable Completion
======================================================

The _programmable completion_ feature in Bash permits typing a partial command, then pressing the **\[Tab\]** key to auto-complete the command sequence. [\[149\]](#FTN.AEN24082) If multiple completions are possible, then **\[Tab\]** lists them all. Let's see how it works.

bash$ **xtra\[Tab\]**
xtraceroute       xtrapin           xtrapproto
 xtraceroute.real  xtrapinfo         xtrapreset
 xtrapchar         xtrapout          xtrapstats

bash$ **xtrac\[Tab\]**
xtraceroute       xtraceroute.real

bash$ **xtraceroute.r\[Tab\]**
xtraceroute.real
      

Tab completion also works for variables and path names.

bash$ **echo $BASH\[Tab\]**
$BASH                 $BASH\_COMPLETION      $BASH\_SUBSHELL
 $BASH\_ARGC            $BASH\_COMPLETION\_DIR  $BASH\_VERSINFO
 $BASH\_ARGV            $BASH\_LINENO          $BASH\_VERSION
 $BASH\_COMMAND         $BASH\_SOURCE

bash$ **echo /usr/local/\[Tab\]**
bin/     etc/     include/ libexec/ sbin/    src/     
 doc/     games/   lib/     man/     share/
      

The Bash **complete** and **compgen** [builtins](#BUILTINREF) make it possible for _tab completion_ to recognize partial _parameters_ and _options_ to commands. In a very simple case, we can use **complete** from the command-line to specify a short list of acceptable parameters.

bash$ **touch sample\_command**
bash$ **touch file1.txt file2.txt file2.doc file30.txt file4.zzz**
bash$ **chmod +x sample\_command**
bash$ **complete -f -X '!\*.txt' sample\_command**

bash$ **./sample\[Tab\]\[Tab\]**
sample\_command
file1.txt   file2.txt   file30.txt
  

The \-f option to _complete_ specifies filenames, and \-X the filter pattern.

For anything more complex, we could write a script that specifies a list of acceptable command-line parameters. The **compgen** builtin expands a list of _arguments_ to _generate_ completion matches.

Let us take a [modified version](#USEGETOPT2) of the _UseGetOpt.sh_ script as an example command. This script accepts a number of command-line parameters, preceded by either a single or double dash. And here is the corresponding _completion script_, by convention given a filename corresponding to its associated command.

**Example J-1. Completion script for _UseGetOpt.sh_**

\# file: UseGetOpt-2
# UseGetOpt-2.sh parameter-completion

\_UseGetOpt-2 ()   #  By convention, the function name
{                 #+ starts with an underscore.
  local cur
  # Pointer to current completion word.
  # By convention, it's named "cur" but this isn't strictly necessary.

  COMPREPLY=()   # Array variable storing the possible completions.
  cur=${COMP\_WORDS\[COMP\_CWORD\]}

  case "$cur" in
    -\*)
    COMPREPLY=( $( compgen -W '-a -d -f -l -t -h --aoption --debug \\
                               --file --log --test --help --' -- $cur ) );;
#   Generate the completion matches and load them into $COMPREPLY array.
#   xx) May add more cases here.
#   yy)
#   zz)
  esac

  return 0
}

complete -F \_UseGetOpt-2 -o filenames ./UseGetOpt-2.sh
#        ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^  Invokes the function \_UseGetOpt-2.

Now, let's try it.

bash$ **source UseGetOpt-2**

bash$ **./UseGetOpt-2.sh -\[Tab\]**
\--         --aoption  --debug    --file     --help     --log     --test
 -a         -d         -f         -h         -l         -t

bash$ **./UseGetOpt-2.sh --\[Tab\]**
\--         --aoption  --debug    --file     --help     --log     --test
  

We begin by [sourcing](#SOURCEREF) the "completion script." This sets the command-line parameters. [\[150\]](#FTN.AEN24160)

In the first instance, hitting **\[Tab\]** after a single dash, the output is all the possible parameters preceded by _one or more_ dashes. Hitting **\[Tab\]** after _two_ dashes gives the possible parameters preceded by _two or more_ dashes.

Now, just what is the point of having to jump through flaming hoops to enable command-line tab completion? _It saves keystrokes._ [\[151\]](#FTN.AEN24173)

Appendix K. Localization
========================

Localization is an undocumented Bash feature.

A localized shell script echoes its text output in the language defined as the system's locale. A Linux user in Berlin, Germany, would get script output in German, whereas his cousin in Berlin, Maryland, would get output from the same script in English.

To create a localized script, use the following template to write all messages to the user (error messages, prompts, etc.).

#!/bin/bash
# localized.sh
#  Script by StÃ©phane Chazelas,
#+ modified by Bruno Haible, bugfixed by Alfredo Pironti.

. gettext.sh

E\_CDERROR=65

error()
{
  printf "$@" >&2
  exit $E\_CDERROR
}

cd $var || error "\`eval\_gettext \\"Can\\'t cd to \\\\\\$var.\\"\`"
#  The triple backslashes (escapes) in front of $var needed
#+ "because eval\_gettext expects a string
#+ where the variable values have not yet been substituted."
#    -- per Bruno Haible
read -p "\`gettext \\"Enter the value: \\"\`" var
#  ...


#  ------------------------------------------------------------------
#  Alfredo Pironti comments:

#  This script has been modified to not use the $"..." syntax in
#+ favor of the "\`gettext \\"...\\"\`" syntax.
#  This is ok, but with the new localized.sh program, the commands
#+ "bash -D filename" and "bash --dump-po-string filename"
#+ will produce no output
#+ (because those command are only searching for the $"..." strings)!
#  The ONLY way to extract strings from the new file is to use the
# 'xgettext' program. However, the xgettext program is buggy.

# Note that 'xgettext' has another bug.
#
# The shell fragment:
#    gettext -s "I like Bash"
# will be correctly extracted, but . . .
#    xgettext -s "I like Bash"
# . . . fails!
#  'xgettext' will extract "-s" because
#+ the command only extracts the
#+ very first argument after the 'gettext' word.


#  Escape characters:
#
#  To localize a sentence like
#     echo -e "Hello\\tworld!"
#+ you must use
#     echo -e "\`gettext \\"Hello\\\\tworld\\"\`"
#  The "double escape character" before the \`t' is needed because
#+ 'gettext' will search for a string like: 'Hello\\tworld'
#  This is because gettext will read one literal \`\\')
#+ and will output a string like "Bonjour\\tmonde",
#+ so the 'echo' command will display the message correctly.
#
#  You may not use
#     echo "\`gettext -e \\"Hello\\tworld\\"\`"
#+ due to the xgettext bug explained above.



# Let's localize the following shell fragment:
#     echo "-h display help and exit"
#
# First, one could do this:
#     echo "\`gettext \\"-h display help and exit\\"\`"
#  This way 'xgettext' will work ok,
#+ but the 'gettext' program will read "-h" as an option!
#
# One solution could be
#     echo "\`gettext -- \\"-h display help and exit\\"\`"
#  This way 'gettext' will work,
#+ but 'xgettext' will extract "--", as referred to above.
#
# The workaround you may use to get this string localized is
#     echo -e "\`gettext \\"\\\\0-h display help and exit\\"\`"
#  We have added a \\0 (NULL) at the beginning of the sentence.
#  This way 'gettext' works correctly, as does 'xgettext.'
#  Moreover, the NULL character won't change the behavior
#+ of the 'echo' command.
#  ------------------------------------------------------------------

bash$ **bash -D localized.sh**
"Can't cd to %s."
 "Enter the value: "

This lists all the localized text. (The \-D option lists double-quoted strings prefixed by a $, without executing the script.)

bash$ **bash --dump-po-strings localized.sh**
#: a:6
 msgid "Can't cd to %s."
 msgstr ""
 #: a:7
 msgid "Enter the value: "
 msgstr ""

The \--dump-po-strings option to Bash resembles the \-D option, but uses [gettext](#GETTEXTREF) "po" format.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Bruno Haible points out:

Starting with gettext-0.12.2, **xgettext -o - localized.sh** is recommended instead of **bash --dump-po-strings localized.sh**, because **xgettext** . . .

1\. understands the gettext and eval\_gettext commands (whereas bash --dump-po-strings understands only its deprecated $"..." syntax)

2\. can extract comments placed by the programmer, intended to be read by the translator.

This shell code is then not specific to Bash any more; it works the same way with Bash 1.x and other /bin/sh implementations.

Now, build a language.po file for each language that the script will be translated into, specifying the _msgstr_. Alfredo Pironti gives the following example:

fr.po:

#: a:6
msgid "Can't cd to $var."
msgstr "Impossible de se positionner dans le repertoire $var."
#: a:7
msgid "Enter the value: "
msgstr "Entrez la valeur : "

#  The string are dumped with the variable names, not with the %s syntax,
#+ similar to C programs.
#+ This is a very cool feature if the programmer uses
#+ variable names that make sense!

Then, run [msgfmt](#MSGFMTREF).

**msgfmt -o localized.sh.mo fr.po**

Place the resulting localized.sh.mo file in the /usr/local/share/locale/fr/LC\_MESSAGES directory, and at the beginning of the script, insert the lines:

TEXTDOMAINDIR=/usr/local/share/locale
TEXTDOMAIN=localized.sh

If a user on a French system runs the script, she will get French messages.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

With older versions of Bash or other shells, localization requires [gettext](#GETTEXTREF), using the \-s option. In this case, the script becomes:

#!/bin/bash
# localized.sh

E\_CDERROR=65

error() {
  local format=$1
  shift
  printf "$(gettext -s "$format")" "$@" >&2
  exit $E\_CDERROR
}
cd $var || error "Can't cd to %s." "$var"
read -p "$(gettext -s "Enter the value: ")" var
# ...

The TEXTDOMAIN and TEXTDOMAINDIR variables need to be set and exported to the environment. This should be done within the script itself.

Appendix L. History Commands
============================

The Bash shell provides command-line tools for editing and manipulating a user's _command history_. This is primarily a convenience, a means of saving keystrokes.

Bash history commands:

1.  **history**
    
2.  **fc**
    

bash$ **history**
   1  mount /mnt/cdrom
    2  cd /mnt/cdrom
    3  ls
     ...
	      

Internal variables associated with Bash history commands:

1.  $HISTCMD
    
2.  $HISTCONTROL
    
3.  $HISTIGNORE
    
4.  $HISTFILE
    
5.  $HISTFILESIZE
    
6.  $HISTSIZE
    
7.  $HISTTIMEFORMAT (Bash, ver. 3.0 or later)
    
8.  !!
    
9.  !$
    
10.  !#
    
11.  !N
    
12.  !-N
    
13.  !STRING
    
14.  !?STRING?
    
15.  ^STRING^string^
    

Unfortunately, the Bash history tools find no use in scripting.

Appendix M. Sample .bashrc and .bash\_profile Files
===================================================

The ~/.bashrc file determines the behavior of interactive shells. A good look at this file can lead to a better understanding of Bash.

[Emmanuel Rouat](mailto:emmanuel.rouat@wanadoo.fr) contributed the following very elaborate .bashrc file, written for a Linux system. He welcomes reader feedback on it.

Study the file carefully, and feel free to reuse code snippets and functions from it in your own .bashrc file or even in your scripts.

# PERSONAL $HOME/.bashrc FILE for bash-3.0 (or later)
# By Emmanuel Rouat \[no-email\]
#
# Last modified: Tue Nov 20 22:04:47 CET 2012

#  This file is normally read by interactive shells only.
#+ Here is the place to define your aliases, functions and
#+ other interactive features like your prompt.
#
#  The majority of the code here assumes you are on a GNU
#+ system (most likely a Linux box) and is often based on code
#+ found on Usenet or Internet.
#
#  See for instance:
#  http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/index.html
#  http://www.caliban.org/bash
#  http://www.shelldorado.com/scripts/categories.html
#  http://www.dotfiles.org
#
#  The choice of colors was done for a shell with a dark background
#+ (white on black), and this is usually also suited for pure text-mode
#+ consoles (no X server available). If you use a white background,
#+ you'll have to do some other choices for readability.
#
#  This bashrc file is a bit overcrowded.
#  Remember, it is just just an example.
#  Tailor it to your needs.

And, here is a snippet from Andrzej Szelachowski's instructive .bash\_profile file.

**Example M-2. .bash\_profile file**

\# From Andrzej Szelachowski's ~/.bash\_profile:


#  Note that a variable may require special treatment
#+ if it will be exported.

DARKGRAY='\\e\[1;30m'
LIGHTRED='\\e\[1;31m'
GREEN='\\e\[32m'
YELLOW='\\e\[1;33m'
LIGHTBLUE='\\e\[1;34m'
NC='\\e\[m'

PCT="\\\`if \[\[ \\$EUID -eq 0 \]\]; then T='$LIGHTRED' ; else T='$LIGHTBLUE'; fi; 
echo \\$T \\\`"

#  For "literal" command substitution to be assigned to a variable,
#+ use escapes and double quotes:
#+       PCT="\\\` ... \\\`" . . .
#  Otherwise, the value of PCT variable is assigned only once,
#+ when the variable is exported/read from .bash\_profile,
#+ and it will not change afterwards even if the user ID changes.


PS1="\\n$GREEN\[\\w\] \\n$DARKGRAY($PCT\\t$DARKGRAY)-($PCT\\u$DARKGRAY)-($PCT\\!
$DARKGRAY)$YELLOW-> $NC"

#  Escape a variables whose value changes:
#        if \[\[ \\$EUID -eq 0 \]\],
#  Otherwise the value of the EUID variable will be assigned only once,
#+ as above.

#  When a variable is assigned, it should be called escaped:
#+       echo \\$T,
#  Otherwise the value of the T variable is taken from the moment the PCT 
#+ variable is exported/read from .bash\_profile.
#  So, in this example it would be null.

#  When a variable's value contains a semicolon it should be strong quoted:
#        T='$LIGHTRED',
#  Otherwise, the semicolon will be interpreted as a command separator.


#  Variables PCT and PS1 can be merged into a new PS1 variable:

PS1="\\\`if \[\[ \\$EUID -eq 0 \]\]; then PCT='$LIGHTRED';
else PCT='$LIGHTBLUE'; fi; 
echo '\\n$GREEN\[\\w\] \\n$DARKGRAY('\\$PCT'\\t$DARKGRAY)-\\
('\\$PCT'\\u$DARKGRAY)-('\\$PCT'\\!$DARKGRAY)$YELLOW-> $NC'\\\`"

# The trick is to use strong quoting for parts of old PS1 variable.

Appendix N. Converting DOS Batch Files to Shell Scripts
=======================================================

Quite a number of programmers learned scripting on a PC running DOS. Even the crippled DOS batch file language allowed writing some fairly powerful scripts and applications, though they often required extensive kludges and workarounds. Occasionally, the need still arises to convert an old DOS batch file to a UNIX shell script. This is generally not difficult, as DOS batch file operators are only a limited subset of the equivalent shell scripting ones.

![Note](../images/note.gif)

Virtually all UNIX and shell operators and commands have many more options and enhancements than their DOS and batch file counterparts. Many DOS batch files rely on auxiliary utilities, such as **ask.com**, a crippled counterpart to [read](#READREF).

DOS supports only a very limited and incompatible subset of filename [wild-card expansion](#GLOBBINGREF), recognizing just the \* and ? characters.

Converting a DOS batch file into a shell script is generally straightforward, and the result ofttimes reads better than the original.

**Example N-1. VIEWDATA.BAT: DOS Batch File**

REM VIEWDATA

REM INSPIRED BY AN EXAMPLE IN "DOS POWERTOOLS"
REM                           BY PAUL SOMERSON


@ECHO OFF

IF !%1==! GOTO VIEWDATA
REM  IF NO COMMAND-LINE ARG...
FIND "%1" C:\\BOZO\\BOOKLIST.TXT
GOTO EXIT0
REM  PRINT LINE WITH STRING MATCH, THEN EXIT.

:VIEWDATA
TYPE C:\\BOZO\\BOOKLIST.TXT | MORE
REM  SHOW ENTIRE FILE, 1 PAGE AT A TIME.

:EXIT0

The script conversion is somewhat of an improvement. [\[152\]](#FTN.AEN24713)

**Example N-2. _viewdata.sh_: Shell Script Conversion of VIEWDATA.BAT**

#!/bin/bash
# viewdata.sh
# Conversion of VIEWDATA.BAT to shell script.

DATAFILE=/home/bozo/datafiles/book-collection.data
ARGNO=1

# @ECHO OFF                 Command unnecessary here.

if \[ $# -lt "$ARGNO" \]    # IF !%1==! GOTO VIEWDATA
then
  less $DATAFILE          # TYPE C:\\MYDIR\\BOOKLIST.TXT | MORE
else
  grep "$1" $DATAFILE     # FIND "%1" C:\\MYDIR\\BOOKLIST.TXT
fi  

exit 0                    # :EXIT0

#  GOTOs, labels, smoke-and-mirrors, and flimflam unnecessary.
#  The converted script is short, sweet, and clean,
#+ which is more than can be said for the original.

Ted Davis' [Shell Scripts on the PC](http://www.maem.umr.edu/batch/) site had a set of comprehensive tutorials on the old-fashioned art of batch file programming. Unfortunately the page has vanished without a trace.

O.1. Analyzing Scripts
======================

Examine the following script. Run it, then explain what it does. Annotate the script and rewrite it in a more compact and elegant manner.

#!/bin/bash

MAX=10000


  for((nr=1; nr<$MAX; nr++))
  do

    let "t1 = nr % 5"
    if \[ "$t1" -ne 3 \]
    then
      continue
    fi

    let "t2 = nr % 7"
    if \[ "$t2" -ne 4 \]
    then
      continue
    fi

    let "t3 = nr % 9"
    if \[ "$t3" -ne 5 \]
    then
      continue
    fi

  break   # What happens when you comment out this line? Why?

  done

  echo "Number = $nr"


exit 0

\---

Explain what the following script does. It is really just a parameterized command-line pipe.

#!/bin/bash

DIRNAME=/usr/bin
FILETYPE="shell script"
LOGFILE=logfile

file "$DIRNAME"/\* | fgrep "$FILETYPE" | tee $LOGFILE | wc -l

exit 0

\---

Examine and explain the following script. For hints, you might refer to the listings for [find](#FINDREF) and [stat](#STATREF).

#!/bin/bash

# Author:  Nathan Coulter
# This code is released to the public domain.
# The author gave permission to use this code snippet in the ABS Guide.

find -maxdepth 1 -type f -printf '%f\\000'  | {
   while read -d $'\\000'; do
      mv "$REPLY" "$(date -d "$(stat -c '%y' "$REPLY") " '+%Y%m%d%H%M%S'
      )-$REPLY"
   done
}

# Warning: Test-drive this script in a "scratch" directory.
# It will somehow affect all the files there.

\---

A reader sent in the following code snippet.

while read LINE
do
  echo $LINE
done < \`tail -f /var/log/messages\`

He wished to write a script tracking changes to the system log file, /var/log/messages. Unfortunately, the above code block hangs and does nothing useful. Why? Fix this so it does work. (Hint: rather than [redirecting the stdin of the loop](#REDIRREF), try a [pipe](#PIPEREF).)

\---

Analyze the following "one-liner" (here split into two lines for clarity) contributed by Rory Winston:

export SUM=0; for f in $(find src -name "\*.java");
do export SUM=$(($SUM + $(wc -l $f | awk '{ print $1 }'))); done; echo $SUM

Hint: First, break the script up into bite-sized sections. Then, carefully examine its use of [double-parentheses](#DBLPARENS) arithmetic, the [export](#EXPORTREF) command, the [find](#FINDREF) command, the [wc](#WCREF) command, and [awk](#AWKREF).

Analyze [Example A-10](#LIFESLOW), and reorganize it in a simplified and more logical style. See how many of the variables can be eliminated, and try to optimize the script to speed up its execution time.

Alter the script so that it accepts any ordinary ASCII text file as input for its initial "generation". The script will read the first _$ROW\*$COL_ characters, and set the occurrences of vowels as "living" cells. Hint: be sure to translate the spaces in the input file to underscore characters.

* * *

O.2. Writing Scripts
====================

Write a script to carry out each of the following tasks.

**EASY**

**Self-reproducing Script**

Write a script that backs itself up, that is, copies itself to a file named backup.sh.

Hint: Use the [cat](#CATREF) command and the appropriate [positional parameter](#SCRNAMEPARAM).

**Home Directory Listing**

Perform a recursive directory listing on the user's home directory and save the information to a file. Compress the file, have the script prompt the user to insert a USB flash drive, then press **ENTER**. Finally, save the file to the flash drive after making certain the flash drive has properly mounted by parsing the output of [df](#DFREF). Note that the flash drive must be _unmounted_ before it is removed.

**Converting [for](#FORLOOPREF1) loops to [while](#WHILELOOPREF) and [until](#UNTILLOOPREF) loops**

Convert the _for loops_ in [Example 11-1](#EX22) to _while loops_. Hint: store the data in an [array](#ARRAYREF) and step through the array elements.

Having already done the "heavy lifting," now convert the loops in the example to _until loops_.

**Changing the line spacing of a text file**

Write a script that reads each line of a target file, then writes the line back to stdout, but with an extra blank line following. This has the effect of _double-spacing_ the file.

Include all necessary code to check whether the script gets the necessary command-line argument (a filename), and whether the specified file exists.

When the script runs correctly, modify it to _triple-space_ the target file.

Finally, write a script to remove all blank lines from the target file, _single-spacing_ it.

**Backwards Listing**

Write a script that echoes itself to stdout, but _backwards_.

**Automatically Decompressing Files**

Given a list of filenames as input, this script queries each target file (parsing the output of the [file](#FILEREF) command) for the type of compression used on it. Then the script automatically invokes the appropriate decompression command (**gunzip**, **bunzip2**, **unzip**, **uncompress**, or whatever). If a target file is not compressed, the script emits a warning message, but takes no other action on that particular file.

**Unique System ID**

Generate a "unique" 6-digit hexadecimal identifier for your computer. Do _not_ use the flawed [hostid](#HOSTIDREF) command. Hint: **[md5sum](#MD5SUMREF) [/etc/passwd](#DATAFILESREF1)**, then select the first 6 digits of output.

**Backup**

Archive as a "tarball" (\*.tar.gz file) all the files in your home directory tree (/home/your-name) that have been modified in the last 24 hours. Hint: use [find](#FINDREF).

Optional: you may use this as the basis of a _backup_ script.

**Checking whether a process is still running**

Given a [process ID](#PROCESSIDREF) (_PID_) as an argument, this script will check, at user-specified intervals, whether the given process is still running. You may use the [ps](#PPSSREF) and [sleep](#SLEEPREF) commands.

**Primes**

Print (to stdout) all prime numbers between 60000 and 63000. The output should be nicely formatted in columns (hint: use [printf](#PRINTFREF)).

**Lottery Numbers**

One type of lottery involves picking five different numbers, in the range of 1 - 50. Write a script that generates five pseudorandom numbers in this range, _with no duplicates_. The script will give the option of echoing the numbers to stdout or saving them to a file, along with the date and time the particular number set was generated. (If your script consistently generates _winning_ lottery numbers, then you can retire on the proceeds and leave shell scripting to those of us who have to work for a living.)

**INTERMEDIATE**

**Integer or String**

Write a script [function](#FUNCTIONREF) that determines if an argument passed to it is an integer or a string. The function will return TRUE (0) if passed an integer, and FALSE (1) if passed a string.

Hint: What does the following expression return when $1 is _not_ an integer?

expr $1 + 0

**[ASCII](#ASCIIDEF) to Integer**

The _atoi_ function in **C** converts a string character to an integer. Write a shell script function that performs the same operation. Likewise, write a shell script function that does the inverse, mirroring the **C** _itoa_ function which converts an integer into an ASCII character.

**Managing Disk Space**

List, one at a time, all files larger than 100K in the /home/username directory tree. Give the user the option to delete or compress the file, then proceed to show the next one. Write to a logfile the names of all deleted files and the deletion times.

**Banner**

Simulate the functionality of the deprecated [banner](#BANNERREF) command in a script.

**Removing Inactive Accounts**

Inactive accounts on a network server waste disk space and may become a security risk. Write an administrative script (to be invoked by _root_ or the [cron daemon](#CRONREF)) that checks for and deletes user accounts that have not been accessed within the last 90 days.

**Enforcing Disk Quotas**

Write a script for a multi-user system that checks users' disk usage. If a user surpasses a preset limit (500 MB, for example) in her /home/username directory, then the script automatically sends her a "pigout" warning e-mail.

The script will use the [du](#DUREF) and [mail](#COMMMAIL1) commands. As an option, it will allow setting and enforcing quotas using the [quota](#QUOTAREF) and [setquota](#SETQUOTAREF) commands.

**Logged in User Information**

For all logged in users, show their real names and the time and date of their last login.

Hint: use [who](#WHOREF), [lastlog](#LASTLOGREF), and parse [/etc/passwd](#DATAFILESREF1).

**Safe Delete**

Implement, as a script, a "safe" delete command, sdel.sh. Filenames passed as command-line arguments to this script are not deleted, but instead [gzipped](#GZIPREF) if not already compressed (use [file](#FILEREF) to check), then moved to a ~/TRASH directory. Upon invocation, the script checks the ~/TRASH directory for files older than 48 hours and [permanently deletes](#RMREF) them. (An better alternative might be to have a second script handle this, periodically invoked by the [cron daemon](#CRONREF).)

_Extra credit:_ Write the script so it can handle files and directories [recursively](#RMRECURS). This would give it the capability of "safely deleting" entire directory structures.

**Making Change**

What is the most efficient way to make change for $1.68, using only coins in common circulations (up to 25c)? It's 6 quarters, 1 dime, a nickel, and three cents.

Given any arbitrary command-line input in dollars and cents ($\*.??), calculate the change, using the minimum number of coins. If your home country is not the United States, you may use your local currency units instead. The script will need to parse the command-line input, then change it to multiples of the smallest monetary unit (cents or whatever). Hint: look at [Example 24-8](#EX61).

**Quadratic Equations**

Solve a _quadratic_ equation of the form _Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0_. Have a script take as arguments the coefficients, **A**, **B**, and **C**, and return the solutions to five decimal places.

Hint: pipe the coefficients to [bc](#BCREF), using the well-known formula, _x = ( -B +/- sqrt( B^2 - 4AC ) ) / 2A_.

**Table of Logarithms**

Using the [bc](#BCREF) and [printf](#PRINTFREF) commands, print out a nicely-formatted table of eight-place natural logarithms in the interval between 0.00 and 100.00, in steps of .01.

Hint: _bc_ requires the \-l option to load the math library.

**Unicode Table**

Using [Example T-1](#ASCIISH) as a template, write a script that prints to a file a complete [Unicode](#UNICODEREF) table.

Hint: Use the \-e option to [echo](#ECHOREF): **echo -e '\\uXXXX'**, where _XXXX_ is the Unicode numerical character designation. This requires [version 4.2](#BASH42) or later of Bash.

**Sum of Matching Numbers**

Find the sum of all five-digit numbers (in the range 10000 - 99999) containing _exactly two_ out of the following set of digits: { 4, 5, 6 }. These may repeat within the same number, and if so, they count once for each occurrence.

Some examples of _matching numbers_ are 42057, 74638, and 89515.

**Lucky Numbers**

A _lucky number_ is one whose individual digits add up to 7, in successive additions. For example, 62431 is a _lucky number_ (6 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 16, 1 + 6 = 7). Find all the _lucky numbers_ between 1000 and 10000.

**Craps**

Borrowing the ASCII graphics from [Example A-40](#PETALS), write a script that plays the well-known gambling game of _craps_. The script will accept bets from one or more players, roll the dice, and keep track of wins and losses, as well as of each player's bankroll.

**Tic-tac-toe**

Write a script that plays the child's game of _tic-tac-toe_ against a human player. The script will let the human choose whether to take the first move. The script will follow an optimal strategy, and therefore never lose. To simplify matters, you may use ASCII graphics:

   o | x |
   ----------
     | x |
   ----------
     | o |
     
   Your move, human (row, column)?

**Alphabetizing a String**

Alphabetize (in ASCII order) an arbitrary string read from the command-line.

**Parsing**

Parse [/etc/passwd](#DATAFILESREF1), and output its contents in nice, easy-to-read tabular form.

**Logging Logins**

Parse /var/log/messages to produce a nicely formatted file of user logins and login times. The script may need to run as _root_. (Hint: Search for the string "LOGIN.")

**Pretty-Printing a Data File**

Certain database and spreadsheet packages use save-files with the fields separated by commas, commonly referred to as _comma-separated values_ or CSVs. Other applications often need to parse these files.

Given a data file with comma-separated [fields](#FIELDREF), of the form:

Jones,Bill,235 S. Williams St.,Denver,CO,80221,(303) 244-7989
Smith,Tom,404 Polk Ave.,Los Angeles,CA,90003,(213) 879-5612
...

Reformat the data and print it out to stdout in labeled, evenly-spaced columns.

**Justification**

Given ASCII text input either from stdin or a file, adjust the word spacing to right-justify each line to a user-specified line-width, then send the output to stdout.

**Mailing List**

Using the [mail](#COMMMAIL1) command, write a script that manages a simple mailing list. The script automatically e-mails the monthly company newsletter, read from a specified text file, and sends it to all the addresses on the mailing list, which the script reads from another specified file.

**Generating Passwords**

Generate pseudorandom 8-character passwords, using characters in the ranges \[0-9\], \[A-Z\], \[a-z\]. Each password must contain at least two digits.

**Monitoring a User**

You suspect that one particular user on the network has been abusing her privileges and possibly attempting to hack the system. Write a script to automatically monitor and log her activities when she's signed on. The log file will save entries for the previous week, and delete those entries more than seven days old.

You may use [last](#LASTREF), [lastlog](#LASTLOGREF), and [lastcomm](#LASTCOMMREF) to aid your surveillance of the suspected fiend.

**Checking for Broken Links**

Using [lynx](#LYNXREF) with the \-traversal option, write a script that checks a Web site for broken links.

**DIFFICULT**

**Testing Passwords**

Write a script to check and validate passwords. The object is to flag "weak" or easily guessed password candidates.

A trial password will be input to the script as a command-line parameter. To be considered acceptable, a password must meet the following minimum qualifications:

*   Minimum length of 8 characters
    
*   Must contain at least one numeric character
    
*   Must contain at least one of the following non-alphabetic characters: @, #, $, %, &, \*, +, \-, \=
    

Optional:

*   Do a dictionary check on every sequence of at least four consecutive alphabetic characters in the password under test. This will eliminate passwords containing embedded "words" found in a standard dictionary.
    
*   Enable the script to check all the passwords on your system. These do not reside in [/etc/passwd](#DATAFILESREF1).
    

This exercise tests mastery of [Regular Expressions](#REGEXREF).

**Cross Reference**

Write a script that generates a _cross-reference_ (_concordance_) on a target file. The output will be a listing of all word occurrences in the target file, along with the line numbers in which each word occurs. Traditionally, _linked list_ constructs would be used in such applications. Therefore, you should investigate [arrays](#ARRAYREF) in the course of this exercise. [Example 16-12](#WF) is probably _not_ a good place to start.

**Square Root**

Write a script to calculate square roots of numbers using _Newton's Method_.

The algorithm for this, expressed as a snippet of Bash [pseudo-code](#PSEUDOCODEREF) is:

\#  (Isaac) Newton's Method for speedy extraction
#+ of square roots.

guess = $argument
#  $argument is the number to find the square root of.
#  $guess is each successive calculated "guess" -- or trial solution --
#+ of the square root.
#  Our first "guess" at a square root is the argument itself.

oldguess = 0
# $oldguess is the previous $guess.

tolerance = .000001
# To how close a tolerance we wish to calculate.

loopcnt = 0
# Let's keep track of how many times through the loop.
# Some arguments will require more loop iterations than others.


while \[ ABS( $guess $oldguess ) -gt $tolerance \]
#       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Fix up syntax, of course.

#      "ABS" is a (floating point) function to find the absolute value
#+      of the difference between the two terms.
#             So, as long as difference between current and previous
#+            trial solution (guess) exceeds the tolerance, keep looping.

do
   oldguess = $guess  # Update $oldguess to previous $guess.

#  =======================================================
   guess = ( $oldguess + ( $argument / $oldguess ) ) / 2.0
#        = 1/2 ( ($oldguess \*\*2 + $argument) / $oldguess )
#  equivalent to:
#        = 1/2 ( $oldguess + $argument / $oldguess )
#  that is, "averaging out" the trial solution and
#+ the proportion of argument deviation
#+ (in effect, splitting the error in half).
#  This converges on an accurate solution
#+ with surprisingly few loop iterations . . .
#+ for arguments > $tolerance, of course.
#  =======================================================

   (( loopcnt++ ))     # Update loop counter.
done

It's a simple enough recipe, and _seems_ at first glance easy enough to convert into a working Bash script. The problem, though, is that Bash has [no native support for floating point numbers](#NOFLOATINGPOINT). So, the script writer needs to use [bc](#BCREF) or possibly [awk](#AWKREF) to convert the numbers and do the calculations. It could get rather messy . . .

**Logging File Accesses**

Log all accesses to the files in /etc during the course of a single day. This information should include the filename, user name, and access time. If any alterations to the files take place, that will be flagged. Write this data as tabular (tab-separated) formatted records in a logfile.

**Monitoring Processes**

Write a script to continually monitor all running processes and to keep track of how many child processes each parent spawns. If a process spawns more than five children, then the script sends an e-mail to the system administrator (or _root_) with all relevant information, including the time, PID of the parent, PIDs of the children, etc. The script appends a report to a log file every ten minutes.

**Strip Comments**

Strip all comments from a shell script whose name is specified on the command-line. Note that the initial [#! line](#SHABANGREF) must not be stripped out.

**Strip HTML Tags**

Strip all the HTML tags from a specified HTML file, then reformat it into lines between 60 and 75 characters in length. Reset paragraph and block spacing, as appropriate, and convert HTML tables to their approximate text equivalent.

**XML Conversion**

Convert an XML file to both HTML and text format.

Optional: A script that converts Docbook/SGML to XML.

**Chasing Spammers**

Write a script that analyzes a spam e-mail by doing DNS lookups on the IP addresses in the headers to identify the relay hosts as well as the originating ISP. The script will forward the unaltered spam message to the responsible ISPs. Of course, it will be necessary to filter out _your own ISP's IP address_, so you don't end up complaining about yourself.

As necessary, use the appropriate [network analysis commands](#COMMUNINFO1).

For some ideas, see [Example 16-41](#ISSPAMMER) and [Example A-28](#ISSPAMMER2).

Optional: Write a script that searches through a list of e-mail messages and deletes the spam according to specified filters.

**Creating man pages**

Write a script that automates the process of creating [man pages](#MANREF).

Given a text file which contains information to be formatted into a _man page_, the script will read the file, then invoke the appropriate [groff](#GROFFREF) commands to output the corresponding _man page_ to stdout. The text file contains blocks of information under the standard _man page_ headings, i.e., NAME, SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, etc.

[Example A-39](#MANED) is an instructive first step.

**Hex Dump**

Do a hex(adecimal) dump on a binary file specified as an argument to the script. The output should be in neat tabular [fields](#FIELDREF), with the first field showing the address, each of the next 8 fields a 4-byte hex number, and the final field the ASCII equivalent of the previous 8 fields.

The obvious followup to this is to extend the hex dump script into a disassembler. Using a lookup table, or some other clever gimmick, convert the hex values into 80x86 op codes.

**Emulating a Shift Register**

Using [Example 27-15](#STACKEX) as an inspiration, write a script that emulates a 64-bit shift register as an [array](#ARRAYREF). Implement functions to _load_ the register, _shift left_, _shift right_, and _rotate_ it. Finally, write a function that interprets the register contents as eight 8-bit ASCII characters.

**Calculating Determinants**

Write a script that calculates determinants [\[153\]](#FTN.AEN25254) by [recursively](#RECURSIONREF0) expanding the _minors_. Use a 4 x 4 determinant as a test case.

**Hidden Words**

Write a "word-find" puzzle generator, a script that hides 10 input words in a 10 x 10 array of random letters. The words may be hidden across, down, or diagonally.

Optional: Write a script that _solves_ word-find puzzles. To keep this from becoming too difficult, the solution script will find only horizontal and vertical words. (Hint: Treat each row and column as a string, and search for substrings.)

**Anagramming**

Anagram 4-letter input. For example, the anagrams of _word_ are: _do or rod row word_. You may use /usr/share/dict/linux.words as the reference list.

**Word Ladders**

A "word ladder" is a sequence of words, with each successive word in the sequence differing from the previous one by a single letter.

For example, to "ladder" from _mark_ to _vase_:

mark --> park --> part --> past --> vast --> vase
         ^           ^       ^      ^           ^

Write a script that solves word ladder puzzles. Given a starting and an ending word, the script will list all intermediate steps in the "ladder." Note that _all_ words in the sequence must be legitimate dictionary words.

**Fog Index**

The "fog index" of a passage of text estimates its reading difficulty, as a number corresponding roughly to a school grade level. For example, a passage with a fog index of 12 should be comprehensible to anyone with 12 years of schooling.

The Gunning version of the fog index uses the following algorithm.

1.  Choose a section of the text at least 100 words in length.
    
2.  Count the number of sentences (a portion of a sentence truncated by the boundary of the text section counts as one).
    
3.  Find the average number of words per sentence.
    
    AVE\_WDS\_SEN = TOTAL\_WORDS / SENTENCES
    
4.  Count the number of "difficult" words in the segment -- those containing at least 3 syllables. Divide this quantity by total words to get the proportion of difficult words.
    
    PRO\_DIFF\_WORDS = LONG\_WORDS / TOTAL\_WORDS
    
5.  The Gunning fog index is the sum of the above two quantities, multiplied by 0.4, then rounded to the nearest integer.
    
    G\_FOG\_INDEX = int ( 0.4 \* ( AVE\_WDS\_SEN + PRO\_DIFF\_WORDS ) )
    

Step 4 is by far the most difficult portion of the exercise. There exist various algorithms for estimating the syllable count of a word. A rule-of-thumb formula might consider the number of letters in a word and the vowel-consonant mix.

A strict interpretation of the Gunning fog index does not count compound words and proper nouns as "difficult" words, but this would enormously complicate the script.

**Calculating PI using Buffon's Needle**

The Eighteenth Century French mathematician de Buffon came up with a novel experiment. Repeatedly drop a needle of length _n_ onto a wooden floor composed of long and narrow parallel boards. The cracks separating the equal-width floorboards are a fixed distance _d_ apart. Keep track of the total drops and the number of times the needle intersects a crack on the floor. The ratio of these two quantities turns out to be a fractional multiple of PI.

In the spirit of [Example 16-50](#CANNON), write a script that runs a Monte Carlo simulation of _Buffon's Needle_. To simplify matters, set the needle length equal to the distance between the cracks, _n = d_.

Hint: there are actually two critical variables: the distance from the center of the needle to the nearest crack, and the inclination angle of the needle to that crack. You may use [bc](#BCREF) to handle the calculations.

**Playfair Cipher**

Implement the Playfair (Wheatstone) Cipher in a script.

The Playfair Cipher encrypts text by substitution of _digrams_ (2-letter groupings). It is traditional to use a 5 x 5 letter scrambled-alphabet _key square_ for the encryption and decryption.

   C O D E S
   A B F G H
   I K L M N
   P Q R T U
   V W X Y Z

Each letter of the alphabet appears once, except "I" also represents
"J". The arbitrarily chosen key word, "CODES" comes first, then all
the rest of the alphabet, in order from left to right, skipping letters
already used.

To encrypt, separate the plaintext message into digrams (2-letter
groups). If a group has two identical letters, delete the second, and
form a new group. If there is a single letter left over at the end,
insert a "null" character, typically an "X."

THIS IS A TOP SECRET MESSAGE

TH IS IS AT OP SE CR ET ME SA GE



For each digram, there are three possibilities.
-----------------------------------------------

1) Both letters will be on the same row of the key square:
   For each letter, substitute the one immediately to the right, in that
   row. If necessary, wrap around left to the beginning of the row.

or

2) Both letters will be in the same column of the key square:
   For each letter, substitute the one immediately below it, in that
   row. If necessary, wrap around to the top of the column.

or

3) Both letters will form the corners of a rectangle within the key square:
   For each letter, substitute the one on the other corner the rectangle
   which lies on the same row.


The "TH" digram falls under case #3.
G H
M N
T U           (Rectangle with "T" and "H" at corners)

T --> U
H --> G


The "SE" digram falls under case #1.
C O D E S     (Row containing "S" and "E")

S --> C  (wraps around left to beginning of row)
E --> S

=========================================================================

To decrypt encrypted text, reverse the above procedure under cases #1
and #2 (move in opposite direction for substitution). Under case #3,
just take the remaining two corners of the rectangle.


Helen Fouche Gaines' classic work, ELEMENTARY CRYPTANALYSIS (1939), gives a
fairly detailed description of the Playfair Cipher and its solution methods.

This script will have three main sections

1.  Generating the _key square_, based on a user-input keyword.
    
2.  Encrypting a _plaintext_ message.
    
3.  Decrypting encrypted text.
    

The script will make extensive use of [arrays](#ARRAYREF) and [functions](#FUNCTIONREF). You may use [Example A-56](#GRONSFELD) as an inspiration.

Appendix P. Revision History
============================

      This document first appeared as a 60-page HOWTO in the late spring
      of 2000. Since then, it has gone through quite a number of updates
      and revisions. This book could not have been written without the
      assistance of the Linux community, and especially of the volunteers
      of the [Linux Documentation Project](http://www.tldp.org).
    

Here is the e-mail to the LDP requesting permission to submit version 0.1.

From thegrendel@theriver.com Sat Jun 10 09:05:33 2000 -0700
Date: Sat, 10 Jun 2000 09:05:28 -0700 (MST)
From: "M. Leo Cooper" <thegrendel@theriver.com>
X-Sender: thegrendel@localhost
To: ldp-discuss@lists.linuxdoc.org
Subject: Permission to submit HOWTO

Dear HOWTO Coordinator,

I am working on and would like to submit to the LDP a HOWTO on the subject
of "Bash Scripting" (shell scripting, using 'bash'). As it happens,
I have been writing this document, off and on, for about the last eight
months or so, and I could produce a first draft in ASCII text format in
a matter of just a few more days.

I began writing this out of frustration at being unable to find a
decent book on shell scripting. I managed to locate some pretty good
articles on various aspects of scripting, but nothing like a complete,
beginning-to-end tutorial.  Well, in keeping with my philosophy, if all
else fails, do it yourself.

As it stands, this proposed "Bash-Scripting HOWTO" would serve as a
combination tutorial and reference, with the heavier emphasis on the
tutorial. It assumes Linux experience, but only a very basic level
of programming skills. Interspersed with the text are 79 illustrative
example scripts of varying complexity, all liberally commented. There
are even exercises for the reader.

At this stage, I'm up to 18,000+ words (124k), and that's over 50 pages of
text (whew!).


I haven't mentioned that I've previously authored an LDP HOWTO, the
"Software-Building HOWTO", which I wrote in Linuxdoc/SGML. I don't know
if I could handle Docbook/SGML, and I'm glad you have volunteers to do
the conversion. You people seem to have gotten on a more organized basis
these last few months. Working with Greg Hankins and Tim Bynum was nice,
but a professional team is even nicer.

Anyhow, please advise.

Appendix T. ASCII Table
=======================

Traditionally, a book of this sort has an [ASCII](#ASCIIDEF) Table appendix. This book does not. Instead, here are several short scripts, each of which generates a complete ASCII table.

**Example T-1. A script that generates an ASCII table**

#!/bin/bash
# ascii.sh
# ver. 0.2, reldate 26 Aug 2008
# Patched by ABS Guide author.

# Original script by Sebastian Arming.
# Used with permission (thanks!).

exec >ASCII.txt         #  Save stdout to file,
                        #+ as in the example scripts
                        #+ reassign-stdout.sh and upperconv.sh.

MAXNUM=256
COLUMNS=5
OCT=8
OCTSQU=64
LITTLESPACE=-3
BIGSPACE=-5

i=1 # Decimal counter
o=1 # Octal counter

while \[ "$i" -lt "$MAXNUM" \]; do  # We don't have to count past 400 octal.
        paddi="    $i"
        echo -n "${paddi: $BIGSPACE}  "       # Column spacing.
        paddo="00$o"
#       echo -ne "\\\\${paddo: $LITTLESPACE}"   # Original.
        echo -ne "\\\\0${paddo: $LITTLESPACE}"  # Fixup.
#                   ^
        echo -n "     "
        if (( i % $COLUMNS == 0)); then       # New line.
           echo
        fi
        ((i++, o++))
        # The octal notation for 8 is 10, and 64 decimal is 100 octal.
        (( i % $OCT == 0))    && ((o+=2))
        (( i % $OCTSQU == 0)) && ((o+=20))
done

exit $?

# Compare this script with the "pr-asc.sh" example.
# This one handles "unprintable" characters.

# Exercise:
# Rewrite this script to use decimal numbers, rather than octal.

**Example T-2. Another ASCII table script**

### Notes

[\[1\]](#AEN62)

These are referred to as [builtins](#BUILTINREF), features internal to the shell.

[\[2\]](#AEN87)

Although [recursion _is_ possible in a shell script](#RECURSIONREF0), it tends to be slow and its implementation is often an [ugly kludge](#FIBOREF).

[\[3\]](#AEN139)

An _acronym_ is an _ersatz_ word formed by pasting together the initial letters of the words into a tongue-tripping phrase. This morally corrupt and pernicious practice deserves appropriately severe punishment. Public flogging suggests itself.

[\[4\]](#AEN147)

Many of the features of _ksh88_, and even a few from the updated _ksh93_ have been merged into Bash.

[\[5\]](#AEN157)

By convention, user-written shell scripts that are Bourne shell compliant generally take a name with a .sh extension. System scripts, such as those found in /etc/rc.d, do not necessarily conform to this nomenclature.

[\[6\]](#AEN205)

More commonly seen in the literature as _she-bang_ or _sh-bang_. This derives from the concatenation of the tokens _sharp_ (#) and _bang_ (!).

[\[7\]](#AEN214)

Some flavors of UNIX (those based on 4.2 BSD) allegedly take a four-byte magic number, requiring a blank after the ! -- **#! /bin/sh**. [According to Sven Mascheck](http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/#details) this is probably a myth.

[\[8\]](#AEN226)

The #! line in a shell script will be the first thing the command interpreter (**sh** or **bash**) sees. Since this line begins with a #, it will be correctly interpreted as a comment when the command interpreter finally executes the script. The line has already served its purpose - calling the command interpreter.

If, in fact, the script includes an _extra_ #! line, then **bash** will interpret it as a comment.

#!/bin/bash

echo "Part 1 of script."
a=1

#!/bin/bash
# This does \*not\* launch a new script.

echo "Part 2 of script."
echo $a  # Value of $a stays at 1.

[\[9\]](#AEN242)

This allows some cute tricks.

#!/bin/rm
# Self-deleting script.

# Nothing much seems to happen when you run this... except that the file disappears.

WHATEVER=85

echo "This line will never print (betcha!)."

exit $WHATEVER  # Doesn't matter. The script will not exit here.
                # Try an echo $? after script termination.
                # You'll get a 0, not a 85.

Also, try starting a README file with a **#!/bin/more**, and making it executable. The result is a self-listing documentation file. (A [here document](#HEREDOCREF) using [cat](#CATREF) is possibly a better alternative -- see [Example 19-3](#EX71)).

[\[10\]](#AEN256)

**P**ortable **O**perating **S**ystem _I_nterface, an attempt to standardize UNI**X**\-like OSes. The POSIX specifications are listed on the [Open Group site](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007904975/toc.htm).

[\[11\]](#AEN269)

To avoid this possibility, a script may begin with a [#!/bin/env bash](#ENVV2REF) _sha-bang_ line. This may be useful on UNIX machines where _bash_ is not located in /bin

[\[12\]](#AEN279)

If _Bash_ is your default shell, then the #! isn't necessary at the beginning of a script. However, if launching a script from a different shell, such as _tcsh_, then you _will_ need the #!.

[\[13\]](#AEN300)

Caution: invoking a _Bash_ script by **sh scriptname** turns off Bash-specific extensions, and the script may therefore fail to execute.

[\[14\]](#AEN315)

A script needs _read_, as well as execute permission for it to run, since the shell needs to be able to read it.

[\[15\]](#AEN327)

Why not simply invoke the script with **scriptname**? If the directory you are in ([$PWD](#PWDREF)) is where scriptname is located, why doesn't this work? This fails because, for security reasons, the current directory (./) is not by default included in a user's [$PATH](#PATHREF). It is therefore necessary to explicitly invoke the script in the current directory with a **./scriptname**.

[\[16\]](#AEN612)

An _operator_ is an agent that carries out an _operation_. Some examples are the common [arithmetic operators](#AROPS1), **\+ - \* /**. In Bash, there is some overlap between the concepts of _operator_ and [keyword](#KEYWORDREF).

[\[17\]](#AEN888)

This is more commonly known as the _ternary_ operator. Unfortunately, _ternary_ is an ugly word. It doesn't roll off the tongue, and it doesn't elucidate. It obfuscates. _Trinary_ is by far the more elegant usage.

[\[18\]](#AEN1001)

**A**merican **S**tandard **C**ode for **I**nformation **I**nterchange. This is a system for encoding text characters (alphabetic, numeric, and a limited set of symbols) as 7-bit numbers that can be stored and manipulated by computers. Many of the ASCII characters are represented on a standard keyboard.

[\[19\]](#AEN1071)

A _PID_, or _process ID_, is a number assigned to a running process. The _PID_s of running processes may be viewed with a [ps](#PPSSREF) command.

**Definition:** A _process_ is a currently executing command (or program), sometimes referred to as a _job_.

[\[20\]](#AEN1124)

The shell does the _brace expansion_. The command itself acts upon the _result_ of the expansion.

[\[21\]](#AEN1199)

Exception: a code block in braces as part of a pipe _may_ run as a [subshell](#SUBSHELLSREF).

ls | { read firstline; read secondline; }
#  Error. The code block in braces runs as a subshell,
#+ so the output of "ls" cannot be passed to variables within the block.
echo "First line is $firstline; second line is $secondline"  # Won't work.

# Thanks, S.C.

[\[22\]](#AEN1564)

Even as in olden times a _philtre_ denoted a potion alleged to have magical transformative powers, so does a UNIX _filter_ transform its target in (roughly) analogous fashion. (The coder who comes up with a "love philtre" that runs on a Linux machine will likely win accolades and honors.)

[\[23\]](#AEN2107)

Bash stores a list of commands previously issued from the command-line in a _buffer_, or memory space, for recall with the [builtin](#BUILTINREF) _history_ commands.

[\[24\]](#AEN2198)

A linefeed (_newline_) is also a whitespace character. This explains why a _blank line_, consisting only of a linefeed, is considered whitespace.

[\[25\]](#AEN2258)

Technically, the _name_ of a variable is called an _lvalue_, meaning that it appears on the _left_ side of an assignment statment, as in **VARIABLE=23**. A variable's _value_ is an _rvalue_, meaning that it appears on the _right_ side of an assignment statement, as in **VAR2=$VARIABLE**.

A variable's _name_ is, in fact, a _reference_, a _pointer_ to the memory location(s) where the actual data associated with that variable is kept.

[\[26\]](#AEN2450)

Note that [_functions_ also take positional parameters](#PASSEDARGS).

[\[27\]](#AEN2464)

The process calling the script sets the $0 parameter. By convention, this parameter is the name of the script. See the [manpage](#MANREF) (manual page) for **execv**.

From the _command-line_, however, $0 is the name of the shell.

bash$ **echo $0**
bash

tcsh% **echo $0**
tcsh

[\[28\]](#AEN2501)

If the the script is [sourced](#SOURCEREF) or [symlinked](#SYMLINKREF), then this will not work. It is safer to check [$BASH\_Source](#BASHSOURCEREF).

[\[29\]](#AEN2609)

Unless there is a file named first in the current working directory. Yet another reason to _quote_. (Thank you, Harald Koenig, for pointing this out.

[\[30\]](#AEN2630)

Encapsulating "!" within double quotes gives an error when used _from the command line_. This is interpreted as a [history command](#HISTCOMMANDS). Within a script, though, this problem does not occur, since the Bash history mechanism is disabled then.

Of more concern is the _apparently_ inconsistent behavior of _\\_ within double quotes, and especially following an **echo -e** command.

bash$ **echo hello\\!**
hello!
bash$ **echo "hello\\!"**
hello\\!

bash$ **echo \\**
\>
bash$ **echo "\\"**
\>
bash$ **echo \\a**
a
bash$ **echo "\\a"**
\\a

bash$ **echo x\\ty**
xty
bash$ **echo "x\\ty"**
x\\ty

bash$ **echo -e x\\ty**
xty
bash$ **echo -e "x\\ty"**
x       y
	      

Double quotes following an _echo_ _sometimes_ escape _\\_. Moreover, the \-e option to _echo_ causes the "\\t" to be interpreted as a _tab_.

(Thank you, Wayne Pollock, for pointing this out, and Geoff Lee and Daniel Barclay for explaining it.)

[\[31\]](#AEN2688)

"Word splitting," in this context, means dividing a character string into separate and discrete arguments.

[\[32\]](#AEN2981)

In those instances when there is no [return](#RETURNREF) terminating the function.

[\[33\]](#AEN3140)

A _token_ is a symbol or short string with a special meaning attached to it (a [meta-meaning](#METAMEANINGREF)). In Bash, certain tokens, such as **\[** and [. (dot-command)](#DOTREF), may expand to _keywords_ and commands.

[\[34\]](#AEN3289)

Per the 1913 edition of _Webster's Dictionary_:

Deprecate
...

To pray against, as an evil;
to seek to avert by prayer;
to desire the removal of;
to seek deliverance from;
to express deep regret for;
to disapprove of strongly.

[\[35\]](#AEN3400)

Be aware that _suid_ binaries may open security holes. The _suid_ flag has no effect on shell scripts.

[\[36\]](#AEN3423)

On Linux systems, the sticky bit is no longer used for files, only on directories.

[\[37\]](#AEN3669)

As S.C. points out, in a compound test, even quoting the string variable might not suffice. **\[ -n "$string" -o "$a" = "$b" \]** may cause an error with some versions of Bash if $string is empty. The safe way is to append an extra character to possibly empty variables, **\[ "x$string" != x -o "x$a" = "x$b" \]** (the "x's" cancel out).

[\[38\]](#AEN3907)

In a different context, **+=** can serve as a _string concatenation_ operator. This can be useful for [modifying _environmental variables_](#PATHAPPEND).

[\[39\]](#AEN4242)

_Side effects_ are, of course, unintended -- and usually undesirable -- consequences.

[\[40\]](#AEN4290)

_Precedence_, in this context, has approximately the same meaning as _priority_

[\[41\]](#AEN4671)

A _stack register_ is a set of consecutive memory locations, such that the values stored (_pushed_) are retrieved (_popped_) in _reverse_ order. The last value stored is the first retrieved. This is sometimes called a _LIFO_ (_last-in-first-out_) or _pushdown_ stack.

[\[42\]](#AEN5154)

The PID of the currently running script is $$, of course.

[\[43\]](#AEN5320)

Somewhat analogous to [recursion](#RECURSIONREF), in this context _nesting_ refers to a pattern embedded within a larger pattern. One of the definitions of _nest_, according to the 1913 edition of _Webster's Dictionary_, illustrates this beautifully: "_A collection of boxes, cases, or the like, of graduated size, each put within the one next larger._"

[\[44\]](#AEN5479)

The words "argument" and "parameter" are often used interchangeably. In the context of this document, they have the same precise meaning: _a variable passed to a script or function._

[\[45\]](#AEN5654)

Within a script, inside a subshell, $$ [returns the PID of the script](#BASHPIDREF), not the subshell.

[\[46\]](#AEN5685)

In this context, _typing_ a variable means to classify it and restrict its properties. For example, a variable _declared_ or _typed_ as an integer is no longer available for [string operations](#STRINGOPSTAB).

declare -i intvar

intvar=23
echo "$intvar"   # 23
intvar=stringval
echo "$intvar"   # 0

[\[47\]](#AEN5817)

True "randomness," insofar as it exists at all, can only be found in certain incompletely understood natural phenomena, such as radioactive decay. Computers only _simulate_ randomness, and computer-generated sequences of "random" numbers are therefore referred to as _pseudorandom_.

[\[48\]](#AEN5857)

The _seed_ of a computer-generated pseudorandom number series can be considered an identification label. For example, think of the pseudorandom series with a seed of _23_ as _Series #23_.

A property of a pseurandom number series is the length of the cycle before it starts repeating itself. A good pseurandom generator will produce series with very long cycles.

[\[49\]](#AEN5987)

This applies to either command-line arguments or parameters passed to a [function](#FUNCTIONREF).

[\[50\]](#AEN6164)

Note that _$substring_ and _$replacement_ may refer to either _literal strings_ or _variables_, depending on context. See the first usage example.

[\[51\]](#AEN6310)

If $parameter is null in a non-interactive script, it will terminate with a [127 exit status](#EXITCODESREF) (the Bash error code for "command not found").

[\[52\]](#AEN6560)

_Iteration_: Repeated execution of a command or group of commands, usually -- but not always, _while_ a given condition holds, or _until_ a given condition is met.

[\[53\]](#AEN6981)

These are shell [builtins](#BUILTINREF), whereas other loop commands, such as [while](#WHILELOOPREF) and [case](#CASEESAC1), are [keywords](#KEYWORDREF).

[\[54\]](#AEN7087)

Pattern-match lines may also _start_ with a **(** left paren to give the layout a more structured appearance.

case $( arch ) in   # $( arch ) returns machine architecture.
  ( i386 ) echo "80386-based machine";;
# ^      ^
  ( i486 ) echo "80486-based machine";;
  ( i586 ) echo "Pentium-based machine";;
  ( i686 ) echo "Pentium2+-based machine";;
  (    \* ) echo "Other type of machine";;
esac

[\[55\]](#AEN7205)

For purposes of _command substitution_, a **command** may be an external system command, an internal scripting [builtin](#BUILTINREF), or even [a script function](#RVT).

[\[56\]](#AEN7211)

In a more technically correct sense, _command substitution_ extracts the stdout of a command, then assigns it to a variable using the \= operator.

[\[57\]](#AEN7308)

In fact, nesting with backticks is also possible, but only by escaping the inner backticks, as John Default points out.

word\_count=\` wc -w \\\`echo \* | awk '{print $8}'\\\` \`

[\[58\]](#AEN8607)

As Nathan Coulter points out, "while forking a process is a low-cost operation, executing a new program in the newly-forked child process adds more overhead."

[\[59\]](#AEN8650)

An exception to this is the [time](#TIMREF) command, listed in the official Bash documentation as a keyword ("reserved word").

[\[60\]](#AEN9009)

Note that _let_ [cannot be used for setting _string_ variables.](#LETBAD)

[\[61\]](#AEN9199)

To _Export_ information is to make it available in a more general context. See also [scope](#SCOPEREF).

[\[62\]](#AEN9289)

An _option_ is an argument that acts as a flag, switching script behaviors on or off. The argument associated with a particular option indicates the behavior that the option (flag) switches on or off.

[\[63\]](#AEN9393)

Technically, an **exit** only terminates the process (or shell) in which it is running, _not_ the _parent process_.

[\[64\]](#AEN9425)

Unless the **exec** is used to [reassign file descriptors](#USINGEXECREF).

[\[65\]](#AEN9591)

_Hashing_ is a method of creating lookup keys for data stored in a table. The _data items themselves_ are "scrambled" to create keys, using one of a number of simple mathematical _algorithms_ (methods, or recipes).

An advantage of _hashing_ is that it is fast. A disadvantage is that _collisions_ -- where a single key maps to more than one data item -- are possible.

For examples of hashing see [Example A-20](#HASHLIB) and [Example A-21](#HASHEXAMPLE).

[\[66\]](#AEN9621)

The _readline_ library is what Bash uses for reading input in an interactive shell.

[\[67\]](#AEN9753)

This only applies to _child processes_, of course.

[\[68\]](#AEN9928)

The C source for a number of loadable builtins is typically found in the /usr/share/doc/bash-?.??/functions directory.

Note that the \-f option to **enable** is not [portable](#PORTABILITYISSUES) to all systems.

[\[69\]](#AEN9949)

The same effect as **autoload** can be achieved with [typeset -fu](#DECLAREREF).

[\[70\]](#AEN10025)

The \-v option also orders the sort by _upper- and lowercase prefixed_ filenames.

[\[71\]](#AEN10228)

_Dotfiles_ are files whose names begin with a _dot_, such as ~/.Xdefaults. Such filenames do not appear in a normal **ls** listing (although an **ls -a** will show them), and they cannot be deleted by an accidental **rm -rf \***. Dotfiles are generally used as setup and configuration files in a user's home directory.

[\[72\]](#AEN10301)

This particular feature may not yet be implemented in the version of the ext2/ext3 filesystem installed on your system. Check the documentation for your Linux distro.

[\[73\]](#AEN10465)

And even when _xargs_ is not strictly necessary, it can speed up execution of a command involving [batch-processing](#BATCHPROCREF) of multiple files.

[\[74\]](#AEN11502)

This is only true of the GNU version of **tr**, not the generic version often found on commercial UNIX systems.

[\[75\]](#AEN11885)

An _archive_, in the sense discussed here, is simply a set of related files stored in a single location.

[\[76\]](#AEN11896)

A _tar czvf ArchiveName.tar.gz \*_ _will_ include dotfiles in subdirectories _below_ the current working directory. This is an undocumented GNU **tar** "feature."

[\[77\]](#AEN12840)

The checksum may be expressed as a _hexadecimal_ number, or to some other base.

[\[78\]](#AEN12849)

For even _better_ security, use the _sha256sum_, _sha512_, and _sha1pass_ commands.

[\[79\]](#AEN12969)

This is a symmetric block cipher, used to encrypt files on a single system or local network, as opposed to the _public key_ cipher class, of which _pgp_ is a well-known example.

[\[80\]](#AEN13030)

Creates a temporary _directory_ when invoked with the \-d option.

[\[81\]](#AEN13320)

A _daemon_ is a background process not attached to a terminal session. Daemons perform designated services either at specified times or explicitly triggered by certain events.

The word "daemon" means ghost in Greek, and there is certainly something mysterious, almost supernatural, about the way UNIX daemons wander about behind the scenes, silently carrying out their appointed tasks.

[\[82\]](#AEN14105)

This is actually a script adapted from the Debian Linux distribution.

[\[83\]](#AEN14214)

The _print queue_ is the group of jobs "waiting in line" to be printed.

[\[84\]](#AEN14218)

Large mechanical _line printers_ printed a single line of type at a time onto joined sheets of _greenbar_ paper, to the accompaniment of [a great deal of noise](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/1403.html). The hardcopy thusly printed was referred to as a _printout_.

[\[85\]](#AEN14280)

For an excellent overview of this topic, see Andy Vaught's article, [Introduction to Named Pipes](http://www2.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue41/2156.html), in the September, 1997 issue of [_Linux Journal_](http://www.linuxjournal.com).

[\[86\]](#AEN14318)

EBCDIC (pronounced "ebb-sid-ick") is an acronym for Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code, an obsolete IBM data format. A bizarre application of the conv=ebcdic option of **dd** is as a quick 'n easy, but not very secure text file encoder.

cat $file | dd conv=swab,ebcdic > $file\_encrypted
# Encode (looks like gibberish).		    
# Might as well switch bytes (swab), too, for a little extra obscurity.

cat $file\_encrypted | dd conv=swab,ascii > $file\_plaintext
# Decode.

[\[87\]](#AEN14523)

A _macro_ is a symbolic constant that expands into a command string or a set of operations on parameters. Simply put, it's a shortcut or abbreviation.

[\[88\]](#AEN14695)

This is the case on a Linux machine or a UNIX system with disk quotas.

[\[89\]](#AEN14727)

The **userdel** command will fail if the particular user being deleted is still logged on.

[\[90\]](#AEN16255)

[\[91\]](#AEN16504)

The \-c option to [mke2fs](#MKE2FSREF) also invokes a check for bad blocks.

[\[92\]](#AEN16659)

Since only _root_ has write permission in the /var/lock directory, a user script cannot set a lock file there.

[\[93\]](#AEN16748)

Operators of single-user Linux systems generally prefer something simpler for backups, such as **tar**.

[\[94\]](#AEN16782)

As of the [version 4 update](#BASH4REF) of Bash, the \-f and \-c options take a block size of 512 when in [POSIX](#POSIX2REF) mode. Additionally, there are two new options: \-b for [socket](#SOCKETREF) buffer size, and \-T for the limit on the number of _threads_.

[\[95\]](#AEN16847)

NAND is the logical _not-and_ operator. Its effect is somewhat similar to subtraction.

[\[96\]](#AEN16975)

In Bash and other Bourne shell derivatives, it is possible to set variables in a single command's environment.

var1=value1 var2=value2 commandXXX
# $var1 and $var2 set in the environment of 'commandXXX' only.

[\[97\]](#AEN17079)

The _killall_ system script should not be confused with the [killall](#KILLALLREF) command in /usr/bin.

[\[98\]](#AEN17134)

A _meta-meaning_ is the meaning of a term or expression on a higher level of abstraction. For example, the _literal_ meaning of _regular expression_ is an ordinary expression that conforms to accepted usage. The _meta-meaning_ is drastically different, as discussed at length in this chapter.

[\[99\]](#AEN17189)

Since [sed](#SEDREF), [awk](#AWKREF), and [grep](#GREPREF) process single lines, there will usually not be a newline to match. In those cases where there is a newline in a multiple line expression, the dot will match the newline.

#!/bin/bash

sed -e 'N;s/.\*/\[&\]/' << EOF   # Here Document
line1
line2
EOF
# OUTPUT:
# \[line1
# line2\]



echo

awk '{ $0=$1 "\\n" $2; if (/line.1/) {print}}' << EOF
line 1
line 2
EOF
# OUTPUT:
# line
# 1


# Thanks, S.C.

exit 0

[\[100\]](#AEN17572)

_Filename expansion_ means expanding filename patterns or templates containing special characters. For example, example.??? might expand to example.001 and/or example.txt.

[\[101\]](#AEN17581)

A _wild card_ character, analogous to a wild card in poker, can represent (almost) any other character.

[\[102\]](#AEN17592)

Filename expansion _can_ match dotfiles, but only if the pattern explicitly includes the dot as a literal character.

~/\[.\]bashrc    #  Will not expand to ~/.bashrc
~/?bashrc      #  Neither will this.
               #  Wild cards and metacharacters will NOT
               #+ expand to a dot in globbing.

~/.\[b\]ashrc    #  Will expand to ~/.bashrc
~/.ba?hrc      #  Likewise.
~/.bashr\*      #  Likewise.

# Setting the "dotglob" option turns this off.

# Thanks, S.C.

[\[103\]](#AEN17822)

Except, as Dennis Benzinger points out, if [using **<<-** to suppress tabs](#LIMITSTRDASH).

[\[104\]](#AEN17884)

By convention in UNIX and Linux, data streams and peripherals ([device files](#DEVFILEREF)) are treated as files, in a fashion analogous to ordinary files.

[\[105\]](#AEN17894)

A _file descriptor_ is simply a number that the operating system assigns to an open file to keep track of it. Consider it a simplified type of file pointer. It is analogous to a _file handle_ in **C**.

[\[106\]](#AEN17906)

Using _file descriptor 5_ might cause problems. When Bash creates a child process, as with [exec](#EXECREF), the child inherits fd 5 (see Chet Ramey's archived e-mail, [SUBJECT: RE: File descriptor 5 is held open](http://groups.google.com/group/gnu.bash.bug/browse_thread/thread/13955daafded3b5c/18c17050087f9f37)). Best leave this particular fd alone.

[\[107\]](#AEN18102)

An external command invoked with an [exec](#EXECREF) does _not_ (usually) fork off a subprocess / subshell.

[\[108\]](#AEN18244)

This has the same effect as a [named pipe](#NAMEDPIPEREF) (temp file), and, in fact, named pipes were at one time used in process substitution.

[\[109\]](#AEN18474)

The **return** command is a Bash [builtin](#BUILTINREF).

[\[110\]](#AEN18568)

However, as Thomas Braunberger points out, a local variable declared in a function _is also visible to functions called by the parent function._

#!/bin/bash

function1 ()
{
  local func1var=20

  echo "Within function1, \\$func1var = $func1var."

  function2
}

function2 ()
{
  echo "Within function2, \\$func1var = $func1var."
}

function1

exit 0


# Output of the script:

# Within function1, $func1var = 20.
# Within function2, $func1var = 20.

This is documented in the Bash manual:

"Local can only be used within a function; it makes the variable name have a visible scope restricted to that function _and its children_." \[emphasis added\] _The ABS Guide author considers this behavior to be a bug._

[\[111\]](#AEN18607)

Otherwise known as _redundancy_.

[\[112\]](#AEN18610)

Otherwise known as _tautology_.

[\[113\]](#AEN18614)

Otherwise known as a _metaphor_.

[\[114\]](#AEN18617)

Otherwise known as a _recursive function_.

[\[115\]](#AEN18632)

Too many levels of recursion may crash a script with a segfault.

#!/bin/bash

#  Warning: Running this script could possibly lock up your system!
#  If you're lucky, it will segfault before using up all available memory.

recursive\_function ()		   
{
echo "$1"     # Makes the function do something, and hastens the segfault.
(( $1 < $2 )) && recursive\_function $(( $1 + 1 )) $2;
#  As long as 1st parameter is less than 2nd,
#+ increment 1st and recurse.
}

recursive\_function 1 50000  # Recurse 50,000 levels!
#  Most likely segfaults (depending on stack size, set by ulimit -m).

#  Recursion this deep might cause even a C program to segfault,
#+ by using up all the memory allotted to the stack.


echo "This will probably not print."
exit 0  # This script will not exit normally.

#  Thanks, StÃ©phane Chazelas.

... as the first word of a command string. Obviously, an alias is only meaningful at the _beginning_ of a command.

[\[117\]](#AEN18676)

However, aliases do seem to expand positional parameters.

[\[118\]](#AEN19045)

The entries in /dev provide mount points for physical and virtual devices. These entries use very little drive space.

Some devices, such as /dev/null, /dev/zero, and /dev/urandom are virtual. They are not actual physical devices and exist only in software.

[\[119\]](#AEN19065)

A _block device_ reads and/or writes data in chunks, or _blocks_, in contrast to a _character device_, which acesses data in _character_ units. Examples of block devices are hard drives, CDROM drives, and flash drives. Examples of character devices are keyboards, modems, sound cards.

[\[120\]](#AEN19093)

Of course, the mount point /mnt/flashdrive must exist. If not, then, as _root_, **mkdir /mnt/flashdrive**.

To actually mount the drive, use the following command: **mount /mnt/flashdrive**

Newer Linux distros automount flash drives in the /media directory without user intervention.

[\[121\]](#AEN19180)

Certain system commands, such as [procinfo](#PROCINFOREF), [free](#FREEREF), [vmstat](#VMSTATREF), [lsdev](#LSDEVREF), and [uptime](#UPTIMEREF) do this as well.

[\[122\]](#AEN19460)

By convention, _signal 0_ is assigned to [exit](#EXITCOMMANDREF).

[\[123\]](#AEN19993)

Setting the [suid](#SUIDREF) permission on the script itself has no effect in Linux and most other UNIX flavors.

[\[124\]](#AEN20041)

In this context, "magic numbers" have an entirely different meaning than the [magic numbers](#MAGNUMREF) used to designate file types.

Quite a number of Linux utilities are, in fact, shell wrappers. Some examples are /usr/bin/pdf2ps, /usr/bin/batch, and /usr/bin/xmkmf.

To be more specific, Bash 4+ has _limited_ support for associative arrays. It's a bare-bones implementation, and it lacks the much of the functionality of such arrays in other programming languages. Note, however, that [associative arrays in Bash seem to execute faster and more efficiently than numerically-indexed arrays](#ASSOCARRTST).

This only works with [pipes](#PIPEREF) and certain other _special_ files.

And while you're at it, consider fixing the notorious [piped read](#PIPEREADREF0) problem.

In fact, he has no credentials or special qualifications. He's a school dropout with no formal credentials or professional experience whatsoever. None. Zero. Nada.

It was hard to resist the obvious pun. No slight intended, since the book is a pretty decent introduction to the basic concepts of shell scripting.

Out of range exit values can result in unexpected exit codes. An exit value greater than 255 returns an exit code [modulo](#MODULOREF) 256. For example, _exit 3809_ gives an exit code of 225 (3809 % 256 = 225).

[\[145\]](#AEN23647)

An update of /usr/include/sysexits.h allocates previously unused exit codes from 64 - 78. It may be anticipated that the range of unallotted exit codes will be further restricted in the future. The author of this document will _not_ do fixups on the scripting examples to conform to the changing standard. This should not cause any problems, since there is no overlap or conflict in usage of exit codes between compiled C/C++ binaries and shell scripts.

[\[146\]](#AEN23892)

This does not apply to **csh**, **tcsh**, and other shells not related to or descended from the classic Bourne shell (**sh**).

In older versions of UNIX, passwords _were_ stored in /etc/passwd, and that explains the name of the file.

[\[148\]](#AEN23969)

Some early UNIX systems had a fast, small-capacity fixed disk (containing /, the root partition), and a second drive which was larger, but slower (containing /usr and other partitions). The most frequently used programs and utilities therefore resided on the small-but-fast drive, in /bin, and the others on the slower drive, in /usr/bin.

This likewise accounts for the split between /sbin and /usr/sbin, /lib and /usr/lib, etc.

[\[149\]](#AEN24082)

This works only from the _command line_, of course, and not within a script.

[\[150\]](#AEN24160)

Normally the default parameter completion files reside in either the /etc/profile.d directory or in /etc/bash\_completion. These autoload on system startup. So, after writing a useful completion script, you might wish to move it (as _root_, of course) to one of these directories.

[\[151\]](#AEN24173)

It has been extensively documented that programmers are willing to put in long hours of effort in order to save ten minutes of "unnecessary" labor. This is known as _optimization_.

[\[152\]](#AEN24713)

Various readers have suggested modifications of the above batch file to prettify it and make it more compact and efficient. In the opinion of the _ABS Guide_ author, this is wasted effort. A Bash script can access a DOS filesystem, or even an NTFS partition (with the help of [ntfs-3g](http://www.ntfs-3g.org)) to do batch or scripted operations.

[\[153\]](#AEN25254)

For all you clever types who failed intermediate algebra, a _determinant_ is a numerical value associated with a multidimensional _matrix_ ([array](#ARRAYREF) of numbers).

For the simple case of a 2 x 2 determinant:

  |a  b|
  |b  a|

The solution is a\*a - b\*b, where "a" and "b" represent numbers.
